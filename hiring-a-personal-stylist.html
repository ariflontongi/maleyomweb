After spending hours upon hours of my precious youth staring blankly into my closet, trying to create interesting&nbsp;outfit combinations from my same old stuff, I became one of them.</p><p>My typical process for getting ready is probably familiar to most:&nbsp;I wear about 20% of my clothes, in go-to outfits that I recycle regularly.&nbsp;Every two or three months—sick of the outfits that have shown up in every recent photo taken of me—I rush off to a&nbsp;store to find something that will finally, maybe&nbsp;"pull my wardrobe together." Instead, more&nbsp;black T-shirts (black is classy, right?) and skinny jeans (can't go wrong with skinny&nbsp;jeans!) find their way into my small New York City closet, along with at least one special, novelty item like a frilly skirt or trendy blouse that I saw in a celebrity photo. Unfortunately, some pieces only make sense on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/kendall-jenner/>Kendall Jenner</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbhwKMQbATqMweB62Y64zW-1920-80.jpg><p>Two months later&nbsp;the cycle begins again. I am woman enough to admit that while there are a lot of things I'm good at in life, fashion is not one of them. It just doesn't come naturally. And as a freelancer who works from home, I don't even have an office or coworkers to dictate an acceptable dress code. So&nbsp;jeans it is. On the nights I have dinner plans or a party, I might resemble&nbsp;Lisbeth Salander one day, Betty Draper the next. But I don't want costumes. I want&nbsp;style.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRWodPpsmu3ACKTCBW9Eke-1920-80.jpg><p>If you have plumbing problems, you hire a plumber, right? So I decided to hire a stylist.</p><p>There are approximately one million personal stylists in New York City,&nbsp;or at least that's what it felt like while trying to pick one out. Some stylists have listings on Yelp, while&nbsp;others work exclusively with celebrities or people with oodles of money. I developed a checklist&nbsp;for my ideal candidate: a portfolio of normal-looking people she's styled; no glaring spelling errors or poorly designed&nbsp;website, since I was paying someone for their taste; and a rate I could afford. I wanted to keep the styling fees near $600—a solid chunk of change, yes, but not an outrageous&nbsp;splurge when you consider&nbsp;the painful cost of my bought-and-unworn clothing purchases every single year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure readability=2><p>"I booked a package that consisted of a three-hour wardrobe consultation, then three hours of shopping."</p></figure><p>Valerie Halfon&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://shopwithval.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Shop With Val</a>&nbsp;checked all&nbsp;my boxes. We had a brief phone consultation, where she gave me a polished pitch on her services. She seemed friendly, but clearly in charge. Though her rates were very affordable, there was no doubt that Shop With Val was a business, not a fashionista's hobby. So I booked a package that consisted of a three-hour wardrobe consultation, then&nbsp;three hours of shopping (with her setting up the clothing in a dressing room ahead of time).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SGVKDgbAnPTSbFRy2S4rm8-1920-80.jpg><p>Val came over on a cold Monday in October. She was fully adorned in jewelry—layered necklaces, rings, bracelets—and had long, perfectly curled hair. This was someone who clearly cared about what she wore, right down to the&nbsp;sparkly nail art. Meanwhile, I was wearing a black T-shirt dusted in white sweater lint. We were off to a great start.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>The two of us sat down at my kitchen table and discussed my measurements, style goals, and favorite brands.&nbsp;("Uh…I guess I saw a shirt at this store once that I really liked," I said,&nbsp;eloquently.)&nbsp;All I knew, besides my shirt and pants sizes, was that I wanted clothes&nbsp;that were&nbsp;sophisticated enough to wear to a nice&nbsp;dinner in Manhattan, yet comfortable enough that I would realistically&nbsp;sit in them all day&nbsp;at work in the privacy of my own home. (Where they would no doubt be&nbsp;combined with&nbsp;a cozy pair of slippers.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Qzx5fb52LDBCXA7YhVmaL-1920-80.jpg><p>Next, we trudged downstairs to my bedroom closet. My thin, felt hangers got a nod of approval since they were not only space saving but gentle on clothing too (yay!). The piles of wrinkled shirts stuffed onto my shelves received a brief-yet-professional grimace (oops). With the exception of socks and underwear, Val and I looked at every item of clothing I owned, one at a time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8AQsD48XfV3bqZ8M9rPsV-1920-80.jpg><p>There was plenty to cringe over. I had a&nbsp;floral, almost Hawaiian,&nbsp;silk shirt that I'd saved since eighth grade just because I was so proud to still fit into it.&nbsp;Val said she could immediately&nbsp;tell&nbsp;how old it was because the clothing company didn't use this sizing system&nbsp;anymore, and hadn't "in a very long time." I had a ruffled skirt with something resembling a petticoat frilling out from underneath it—an attempt at professional wear during my college internships.&nbsp;There was an old prom dress I was holding onto just in case I ever needed a fairy-princess costume&nbsp;in a pinch. Val allowed me to keep it, but only for costumes, please.</p><figure readability=2><p>"I'd accepted that most things were either too long or too short for me, and I'd just have to deal."</p></figure><p>First came those rejects, then clothes that&nbsp;could be salvaged with some accessorizing or other styling&nbsp;TLC. For my many&nbsp;loose, comfortable shirts,&nbsp;Val suggested a&nbsp;belt around the waist to accentuate my curves. Other clothing went to the dry-cleaners. "It really brightens them up," Val said, and once they were wrinkle-free, they'd actually be desirable picks again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mgS9F9MydqdPGEaywH2cig-1920-80.jpg><p>Finally, there was the clothing that needed to be tailored. At 5'10, many of&nbsp;my nice&nbsp;skirts and dresses&nbsp;hit me unflatteringly at mid-calf.&nbsp;I'd accepted that most things were either too long or too short for me, and I'd just have to deal.&nbsp;Apparently you can pay people to customize your clothes. Magic!&nbsp;A beloved&nbsp;gold dress that belonged to my mother in the early '90s was a favorite, but I didn't love the very dated mermaid hem, which once again cut me off at the calf.&nbsp;We decided to give&nbsp;it a modern makeover by cutting it off at the knee.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Mipd9kVioyitJ2nhsTJJA-1920-80.jpg><p>The jumble of clothing on my bed was intimidating, but a&nbsp;a pattern emerged. I really like the colors blue and black. I prefer solids to patterns. I enjoy well-made, minimalist piece with small details like lace or studs to make them interesting.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SHfBaKAdNrGARPowow4cTL-1920-80.jpg><p>With these clues in mind, Val and I headed out for part two: shopping at a stately department store,&nbsp;Lord and Taylor. Most of the pieces she picked out for me were items just to round out the wardrobe I already had, and ever-so-slightly step it up—so tan booties instead of my usual sneakers, skinny black pants that were essentially dressy leggings, the all-important blazer to make an outfit dinner-appropriate. It was a shopping spree straight out of a movie montage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKE4gEzYqbcqa5dFjNhoUV-1920-80.jpg><p>Like those rom-com heroines, I left the revolving doors feeling strangely at peace. I had hired Val expecting a process that was half psychic reading, half extreme makeover. But a personal stylist—or a good one, at least—doesn't dress you up in trendy costumes or make you over into someone you're not. She gives you&nbsp;the tools you need&nbsp;(like conviction) to stop searching for the better, chicer version of yourself. I could take who I was, tie a belt around it, and step outside.</p><p><strong>Follow&nbsp;</strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://instagram.com/marieclairemag referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><strong>Marie Claire on Instagram</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for the latest celeb news, pretty pics, funny stuff, and an insider POV.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJ6RqLWqu81omGpuZ2yEcLTIq6Cnn12WerGx0aymp5mcYsC1xcuiqq1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1590576-track-dbanj-don-jazzy-link-lovely-photos-fans-beg-music.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>One More Track: Dbanj and Don Jazzy Link Up in Lovely Photos, Fans Beg Them for New Music</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1545731-nicholas-galitzines-relationship-history-dated.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicholas Galitzines relationship history: who has he dated?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
