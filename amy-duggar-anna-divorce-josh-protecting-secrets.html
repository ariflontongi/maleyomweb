You’ve constructed a life and a family with him.</p><p>"You didn’t choose any of this, and your kids certainly didn’t either. I’m not coming after you with some sort of tough love thing. This is what’s simply on my heart and I can’t help but to express it..."</p><p>The <a href=#>Counting On</a> alum then claimed she read a letter that Anna's dad wrote in "support" of Josh.</p><p>"It’s no wonder you’re struggling to know what to do to protect your own kids," Amy said.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"...
