While it doesn't seem like there's ever been direct contact between both artists, the tension between them has been in the air since last year. It's arguable their beef played a factor in XXXTENTACION rise to fame, neither have really buried the hatchet. Earlier this morning, X seemed to have taken some sort of shots at Drake but he later backtracked and claimed that he was hacked.</p><p>Earlier today, XXXTENTACION&nbsp;social media accounts shared some questionable&nbsp;posts directed at Drake. Initially, there was a photo of man who looked like Drake performing fellatio. The post was taken down but X's Instagram story had another claim thats said Drake was trying to kill him.</p><p>"IF ANYONE TRIES TO KILL ME IT WAS @champagnepapi IM SNITCHING RN," he wrote.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/BfmtjJ5lutj</a><br></p><p>However, after all of these were deleted, he attempted to clear the air by saying he was hacked.</p><p>"Please stop entertaining that bullshit on Twitter, my accounts were previously hacked." He wrote on his IG story.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfm3oIYlVNn</a><br></p><p>Drake and XXXTENTACION's issues with each other seemed to be reignited after the video for "God's Plan" dropped and Drizzy challenged his followers to do a good deed for someone. Many took it as Drake stealing X's #HelpingHandChallenge. Regardless, both of them have denied that they have any problems with each other over that.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZn95gJNmr7GwpJq7ta3CoqanZaOWxrR5x6KqZqufmLaiuIymnJ2hkWLEor%2BMoZico5WZeqKy056pZqukp66vs8Rmm6uZm5p6sbvSrapmppWswA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1596939-shehu-sani-reacts-nigerian-lawmakers-propose-year-term-president-govs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;Loot and Go&amp;quot;: Shehu Sani Reacts as Lawmakers Propose Six year Term For President, Governors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./xolo-mariduena-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Xolo Mariduea Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
