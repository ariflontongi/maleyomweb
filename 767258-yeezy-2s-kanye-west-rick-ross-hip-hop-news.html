Whether it's expensive collabs, sought-after restocks and sold-out scalps, or just expensive things in general, he has a lot of pull in the game. But the Chicago artist isn't just commercially successful in these regards, but also very influential. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a> recently commented on his <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a> Air <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> 2 sneaker, specifically holding up his legendary Red Octobers at an event. As a sneakerhead himself, he remarked on how this design and style changed the game.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"This s**t right here was revolutionary," Rick Ross said of Kanye West's Nike Air Yeezy 2 sneakers. "Yeah, this was... it was revolutionary. But you know, these joints, the grey ones? I wanna say with the mauve, the pink, whatever. Yeah, yeah, you know, they was just... I had them, I wore them every day. On some just, you know, you realize how genius the artwork was after the fact." Now that there are <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">restocks of old Yeezy products</a>, there's a lot of conversation around the brand and Ye's many fashion ventures.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-yeezy-2s-get-rick-ross-seal-of-revolutionary-status-watch>Yeezy 2s Get Rick Ross' Seal Of "Revolutionary" Status: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the two "Devil In A New Dress" collaborators have a strong relationship together, and one that almost became even closer recently. Of course, a big debate right now is how much Kanye West we should be celebrating amid <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his antisemitic and far right ties</a>. This caused the distribution of his collab album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures, to become very difficult to secure. Then, Rick Ross actually reflected on whether the duo could reach out to his <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Maybach Music Group</a> for distribution, and while it clearly didn't manifest, it would've been interesting to see one rapper support another.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Imagine if Ye came and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">allowed MMG to distribute his new project</a>," he remarked on his Instagram Story back in October. "Imagine that. What’s your favorite Rick Ross, Ye collab? Imagine that. Imagine the artistic drive. And I got some amazing ideas for the&nbsp;Yeezy&nbsp;brand. Amazing ideas for the Yeezy brand!

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
