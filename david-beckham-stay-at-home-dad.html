She's two and a half. "She just says, 'No'. But anything that she picks out, she looks amazing in, so it's easy. "He added, "(The boys have) already said they're having tattoos done. And I said, 'Well, be different, don’t have any tattoos.' And they said, 'No, we're going to have one. We're going to have, 'Mum and Dad'.'
