Where does that leave the House of Hugh Hefner today?</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Apparently, with a thirst for IRL experiences that recapture the lust and luxury of Playboy's pre-internet legacy. As the Playboy fleshes out its approach to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">digital content</a> — including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">its first gay male cover star</a>, Bretman Rock — the company is simultaneously hearkening back to the days of smoking jackets and Farrah Fawcett by launching <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">BIGBUNNY</a>, a luxury lifestyle brand.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Taking its name from the recently revived <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Big Bunny private jet</a> — an opulent antique from the era of Hefner updated for today's affluent traveler — BIGBUNNY is designed for sophisticated types who actually would read Playboy for the articles.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Whereas <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">mainline Playboy merch</a> has been available (and quite popular) for years, BIGBUNNY is of a loftier flavor.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"Playboy represents the freedom to be who you are and who you want to be, wherever you are," Rachel Webber, Playboy's Chief Brand Officer, told Highsnobiety. "BIGBUNNY is the ultimate expression of that lifestyle. It’s for a community that traverses the world — physically and digitally — seeking out new ideas on art, culture, identity, sex and self-expression."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"FLIGHT 001," the debut BIGBUNNY line, encompasses 25 polished pieces that only whisper of their Playboy pedigree. Prices start at $75 and reach $1,250 for the cashmere blankets, robe coats, silk lounge sets, leather safari jackets, and travel cases.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"[This first collection] is oversized wrap coats that go from the plane to the gallery meeting," explained Webber. "Silk separates that work as well lounging at home as they do at the party. Featherweight blanket puffers for comfort and warmth. Toiletry kits that double as elegant clutches and travel bags. Day to night. Comfort to chic."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"There are no more seasons or outdated ideas of formality and uniformity. We are all meeting up in new and exciting places around the world (and now the metaverse)."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Shot with all the gravitas of a high fashion editorial, the campaign imagery is deservingly lush, soaking in the feel of BIGBUNNY's well-heeled ethos.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"We had the greatest time concepting and developing this campaign," BIGBUNNY creative directors Pilar Zeta and Philippa Price told us.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"We poured over our amazing Playboy archives, watching footage of the original Big Bunny flights and gaining inspiration from the incredible 70s fashion and style. We wanted to capture that aesthetic in a contemporary way, a modern sophistication and a boldness."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">To reiterate that stealth-wealth motif, garments are embossed with "N950PB" — the Big Bunny jet's tail number — and thematic text. The only real obvious bit of branding is the original Big Bunny logo, occasionally cut off below the nose or hidden in a graphic to further obscure its origins.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">The willful obfuscation isn't because Playboy is attempting to shield BIGBUNNY from its heritage. Far from it: BIGBUNNY and the Big Bunny Jet are very much the bleeding edge of Playboy's urbane facelift and their low-key approach to luxury is demonstrative of New Playboy.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"From a business perspective, the launch of BIGBUNNY demonstrates the transformation we’ve made as a company — from a media business into a global lifestyle brand," said Webber, citing collaborations with <a href=#>Supreme</a>, Amiri, and <a href=#>Hatton Labs</a> as indicative of Playboy's high-end crossover appeal.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"The Playboy brand today is bigger than ever before, generating billions of dollars of consumer spend around the world on products and services that allow our community to express itself and embrace a lifestyle of sophistication, individuality, pleasure and fun."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"We were particularly inspired by how diverse the community of passengers was on the original flights, and how much fun they all had together," continued Zeta and Price.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">So, expect BIGBUNNY to be making plenty more flights in the not-so-distant future as it continues to mine its vision of contemporary, inclusive luxury. This ain't your grandpa's Playboy, nor does it want to be.</p><h3 class="title___VeFRS family-sans-black-upper--s___rT0g3 productModuleCarouselTitle___fBA3w">Shop our favorite products</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXGoaqnp5KesrXFjZympmegZL2trdibprJlkp60o8HNp7BmmqKWu6V5yKernqqmnrK4ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raj-kanodia-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Raj Kanodia Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./piers-morgans-wife-celia-walden-begs-tv-bosses-to-give-him-a-job.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Piers Morgan's wife Celia Walden begs TV bosses to give him a job</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
