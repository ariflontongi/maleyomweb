Emery’s team have already accumulated 24 offsides against so far this term – at least five more than any other team.</p><p><b>Aston Villa vs Brighton tip 2:</b> Brighton 5+ offsides @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6/4 with Sky Bet</a></p><h3>Villa’s trend for multiple home goals can continue</h3><p>The West Midlanders have scored at least twice in 10 of their past 12 home Premier League games and there should be chances for them to continue that trend against a Seagulls side that have shipped multiple goals in 10 of 18 away trips under De Zerbi.</p><p>This contest is unlikely to be all blood and thunder, with the tactical ideas of the two coaches providing the framework for a classic game of chess on the football pitch.</p><p>But there should still be a reasonable amount of fouls committed, particularly in a congested midfield area where both teams will be desperate to deny their opponent any time on the ball.</p><p>Solly March, who was replaced after 45 minutes against Chelsea in a sign that he could be in line to start on Saturday, has committed the most fouls of any Brighton player this season and can hit the 2+ target here for a third consecutive Premier League game.</p><p>The two teams’ possession stats this season suggest Brighton will have the lion’s share here and Villa may rack up a few more fouls than the visitors as a result.</p><p>The Villans have committed an average of just over 11 per game in the Premier League so far this term, but have not yet faced a team who dominate possession as much as Brighton.</p><p><b>Aston Villa vs Brighton tip 3:</b> BuildABet: Aston Villa to score 2+ goals, Solly March 2+ fouls and Aston Villa 12+ fouls @ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">11/2 BuildABet with Sky Bet</a></p><h3>Aston Villa vs Brighton odds</h3><p>Odds are correct at the time of publication and are subject to change.</p><h3>Aston Villa team news&nbsp;</h3><p>Leon Bailey is out with a thigh strain and will miss the fixture while Emi Buendia and Tyrone Mings remain long-term absentees.</p><p><b>Aston Villa predicted line-up (4-4-2):</b> Martinez;
