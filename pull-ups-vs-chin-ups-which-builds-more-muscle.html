chin-ups?</p><p>According to some enthusiastic Reddit users — chin-ups are "better" than pull-ups after a debate kicked off when a Reddit user asked about the difference between the two upper-body strength exercises.</p><p>People were quick to point out the muscles the two variations train, but some argued there's no real benefit to pull-ups as chin-ups work the same muscles, if not more.</p><p>To clarify, chin-ups are a supinated or underhand grip, while pull-ups are a pronated or overhand grip.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"Chin-ups are going to involve a larger amount of muscle and are much easier to progress on weighted and progression is the key to results," one Reddit user explained.</p><p>Another agreed, adding: "Chin-ups also allow a greater range of motion when done properly because they allow the elbows to travel farther behind the back causing a greater contraction."</p><p>Others said chin ups work biceps more because it uses extra muscle mass.</p><img

avoid a poor ROM (range of motion) caused by people using very wide grips on pull-ups (people do this in the hopes that will hit the lats better, but that's a false belief)," said another supporter of chin ups.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The debate sparked when the Reddit user wanted clarification on why Martin Berkhan, a Swedish nutritional consultant and self-described "God of intermittent fasting" recommended chin ups in his book, The Leangains Method.</p><p>"Does anyone know why the leangains book specifies chin-ups over pull ups in the RPT chapter?" the user had asked.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Myth busted</h2><p>So what's the answer?</p><p>Experts say both movements are equally as effective and when it comes to activating the lats and traps (muscles in your back) they both work.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-lifestyle">Related articles</h2><p>According to Sydney-based exercise physiologist Drew Harrisberg, one is no better than the other.</p><p>"They both have their benefits," Harrisberg told news.com.au</p><p>"You work your biceps through full range of motion in chin-ups, whereas in pull-ups you're working your lats more because your biceps are at a disadvantage."</p><p>He said it has long been debated, but essentially it comes down to is your (fitness) goals, grip, and width of your hand when doing the movements.</p><p>"You can do a narrow grip pull-up which will give you very similar benefits to a narrow chin-up but the difference, and this is where it gets tricky, is how wide the hand is," he said.</p><p>"If you do a wide grip pull-up vs shoulder-width or narrow grip chin-up, then you will see some significant differences because different muscles will contribute different amounts to the lift.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"Why? When you do a chin-up you are in a position where your biceps can go through a full range of motion at the elbow joint, because your hands are facing you and your grip is narrow."</p><p>However, Harrisberg said when doing a wide grip pull-up, as your hands are in a fixed position, to get your chin over the bar your biceps will initiate and ultimately help lift you up.</p><p>"But it comes to a point when your biceps/ elbow joints are at a biomechanical disadvantaged position as it can no longer bend through full range of motion because your hands are fixed, this is when the lats are forced to work extra hard."</p><p>According to the training site TNation, you can effectively train the lats, biceps, mid, and lower traps with either the pull-up or chin-up.</p><p>"Although, a simple tweak in your pull-up or chin-up form can make far more of a difference than pronation and supination ever could," a report into the two exercises read.</p><p>"But to get the most benefit, you'll have to stick to strict pulling. One study found that there was significantly lower amounts of activity in the mid-traps, lats, and biceps during the kipping pull-up than in the other strict variations."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>So there you have it — just keep doing both.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZqmtnKF6trzSZq2sZZOdtq951KmqZq%2BYnrCpecGuoKWco2K6sL7EZqSuq5OhsnCToZKCko14iJ6MkbmMhY6MYomijo20bIJwgV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ray-cash-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ray Cash Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./project-runway-star-tim-gunn-hasnt-had-sex-29-years-intense-relationship-284833.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Project Runway Star Tim Gunn Hasnt Had Sex For 29 Years After Intense Relationship</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
