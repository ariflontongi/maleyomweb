That included one interview where they spoke about <a href=#>whether they have friendships</a> with certain castmates after the spinoff show.</p><p>Based on <a href=#>Shan’s comments</a> and recent tweets, she is not on friendly terms with Angela or Alyssa. In a series of since-deleted tweets, she called out Alyssa for her friendship with Xavier and how she went for revenge against him on The Challenge: USA.</p><p>“Imagine being so thirsty for attention that you endure an entire casting process to seek revenge against a cultural movement that you gave lip service to,” Shan wrote in a tweet, tagging Alyssa Lopez.</p><p>“Imagine going from being best friends with X and the Cookout to being best friends with Mrs. ‘I’m so ghetto because my skin is looking more tanned,'” Shan said in another tweet aimed at Alyssa.</p><p>A Challenge superfan account, @thechallengeshaderoom, captured the tweets on Instagram (below). A second slide in the IG post shows another tweet in which Shan went after Angela in addition to Alyssa.</p><p>“Angela may be a racist Klanswoman with no feeling in her face but at least she’s smart and thinks things through… let’s see how far your ‘big move’ gets you. @alyssalopez,” Shan tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Angela Rummans was part of the Big Brother 20 cast, which also featured Tyler Crispen, to whom she is now engaged. Monsters and Critics previously reported about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angela defending Tyler</a> over the drama that went down with other castmates during their BB 20 season.</p><p>Shan’s tweets about Alyssa and Angela arrived on Friday afternoon, a few days after The Challenge: USA, Episode 4 aired on CBS. As of Friday evening, her account was no longer showing as active on Twitter, so the tweets were gone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shan was featured in recent Survivor season</h2><p>Shan wasn’t part of Big Brother with Angela Rummans or Alyssa Lopez, as she’s from the world of Survivor, participating in 2021’s Season 41, which took place in Mamanuca Islands,&nbsp;Fiji. The 35-year-old Canadian lasted until Day 19 and finished in eleventh place.</p><p>However, she was involved in getting several castmates ousted from the game before her exit. She did that by teaming up with Ricard Foyé to mastermind their eliminations.</p><p>Ultimately Shan’s top ally in the game was also responsible for eliminating her from Survivor 41, which she spoke about in 2021 with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>On The Challenge: USA, she was part of what looked to be another strong Survivor alliance, consisting of former winners and other cast members.</p><p>However, Shan was also considered someone that may have had a target on her back. Since her Survivor season had just recently aired, it may have left some of her new castmates seeing her as someone they might not be able to trust.</p><p>Even with an early exit from The Challenge: USA, she seems fully capable of returning to The Challenge in the future. Shan will likely be looking for her own revenge if Angela, Alyssa, or Kyland are also there.</p><p>The Challenge: USA airs Wednesdays at 9/8c on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Sdsm6vx5qjpZ2enLJuwdKaqmarmJa7br%2FMoquhZZKhrrTA0maamqukoq61sdJmoKdlo567pLGMnZylnaSasW65xKyqmp%2BVqHqkrculqmaakmLAta3RZqmam5mowW63y5qlrK%2Bfoq6vew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1593065-the-french-erin-brockovich-goodyear.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The French 'Erin Brockovich' vs Goodyear</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-bluetones-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Bluetones Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
