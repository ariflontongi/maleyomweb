Moreover, with Scottie and Michael in the midst of a feud, it felt like this relationship was some bizarre revenge plot. However, the two assured fans this was not the case. Instead, they professed their love for one another at every turn and had no care in the world for what the haters were saying.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse this past week when it was reported that the two had <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">unfollowed each other on social media.</a> Furthermore, Larsa had posted some messages on her Instagram story that made it seem like the two were no longer together.

Instead, the pairing could be on their way to a permanent breakup. The outlet did report that Pippen and Jordan are still talking, which is a decent sign. Regardless, people are already talking quite a bit about this and the couple will continue to make headlines for weeks to come.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about these two, in the comments section down below.
