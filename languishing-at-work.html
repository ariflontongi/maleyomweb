"They were for languishing." Keyes is an expert on the phenomenon, and has <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Languishing-Alive-Again-World-Wears-ebook/dp/B0CCHTQKVH data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="written a new book, Languishing" data-vars-ga-product-id=9a0e9f93-0833-4a88-824d-9f0d57245806 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Languishing-Alive-Again-World-Wears-ebook/dp/B0CCHTQKVH data-product-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Languishing-Alive-Again-World-Wears-ebook/dp/B0CCHTQKVH data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Languishing-Alive-Again-World-Wears-ebook/dp/B0CCHTQKVH data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"73f36449-646d-480d-bdba-369f484c6984","network":{"name":"Amazon"}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1aa4e0ba-255c-4ff2-9cf9-85583175908a class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">written a new book, Languishing</a>, all about it. It was the subject of The New York Times’s most-read, most-cited article of 2021. There is an appetite, it seems, for identifying this feeling of demotivation and aimlessness which seems to be particularly prevalent in our working lives.</p><img alt=logo title=logo width=1875 height=2850 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/65cdf16251d7d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Penguin Random House</span></p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">How do I know if I'm suffering from it?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I would describe languishing as the absence of mental health," says Keyes. "It is a lack of hope and interest in life, or belief in the good things in life." To help us identify it, he outlines a few key symptoms...</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-lkg23o emevuu60">1/ You feel emotionally flattened.</p><p>2/ It’s hard to muster up excitement for events and milestones on the horizon. A sense of inevitability has washed over you. Your life circumstances seem increasingly dictated by external forces.</p><p>3/ You find yourself procrastinating on tasks at work and in your personal life as a why-try-anyway attitude sets in.</p><p>4/ More and more things strike you as irrelevant, superficial, or boring.</p><p>5/ You have the constant feeling of unease that you’re missing something that will make your life feel complete again, but you can’t figure out what it is.</p><p>6/ You feel disconnected from your own community and a greater purpose or cause.</p><p>7/ Your job once gave you a sense of meaning, or at least accomplishment, but it is starting to seem pointless in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>8/ You regularly experience brain fog (for example, standing in the shower and trying to remember whether you’ve washed your hair yet).</p><p>9/ Small setbacks that you might once have weathered fairly easily leave you feeling defeated. You feel restless, even rootless.</p><p>10/ It’s hard to find the motivation to reach out to friends and family and to maintain relationships that were once important to you. You’ve been finding it more difficult to feel close to people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If any or all of these symptoms resonate with you, you be languishing – and it may be as a result of your professional life.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">What can I do about it?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"One of the most common triggers for languishing is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a26302594/symptoms-of-anxiety-high-functioning-stress/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="burn out" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">burn out</a>," Keyes says. "Our working lives, especially with the advent of smartphones and constant emails, have become totally consuming but, because we often have more to do than we can actually accomplish, it becomes really overwhelming and not at all satisfying."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the face of more work than resources and more outgoing costs than incoming wages, what feels stagnant is our hope. An overarching summary of languishing would be: what’s the point anymore? Keyes recommends taking back control as a weapon against this rising sense of futility.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It is firstly important to acknowledge that we should avoid self-blame in these situations," he stresses. "A very large part of languishing is environment-driven; a stressful workplace, an unsupportive team, it is not something innate to us. But that doesn’t mean we are helpless to do anything."</p><img alt="stress at work" title="Stress at work" width=3675 height=2439 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shutterstock-editorial-5886127aj-65817ac0aa502.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">New Regency Pictures/Kobal/Shutterstock</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"First, you need to employ compassion towards yourself," Keyes advises. "I think our default reaction to languishing is: I feel this way because I'm not doing a good enough job. I'm not good enough at this. I'm not efficient, I don't do things as quickly as somebody else. Sometimes that might be true, but it is never true of everyone all the time. So, go easy on yourself."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What we can do is recognise the part we play in our lives, the part we can control. Unsurprisingly, this involves the setting of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/people-parties/bazaar-at-work/a38869031/how-to-set-boundaries-at-work/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=boundaries class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">boundaries</a>: for example, not answering emails outside work hours. "You have more bad habits at work than you think," says Keyes. "I have recognised this in myself, there is a lot of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a37807199/can-anxiety-be-a-superpower/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=anxiety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">anxiety</a> to stepping back and closing that inbox, but it is the right thing in the long run."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Acknowledging languishing also means talking about it and seeking out support from those around you. Don’t forget, you can hardly be alone in the feeling and, as part of our workplace, we have a duty to be as supportive to our colleagues as possible.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There's nothing wrong with being challenged, and even sometimes overwhelmed," says Keyes. "But when we're overwhelmed in an environment that can allow us to talk about that, and be supported and learn and grow, and ask for help, it's amazing how we can function so well, during some of the most demanding situations."</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">How do I move from languishing to flourishing?</h2><img alt="selfish at work career, office" title="Selfish at work - career, office" width=747 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bazaar-at-work-career-office-1612436233.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Josh Shinner for Harper's Bazaar</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What we are aiming for is languishing’s more upbeat cousin: flourishing. A lot of languishing derives from a feeling of having no purpose, often as a result of a job we no longer feel connected to, or because whatever we do has consumed so much of our time, that we struggle to find purpose beyond it. As Keyes says: "Work was not meant to be our only saviour when it comes to our purpose in life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"A lot of what I hear from people who are languishing is that they lack purpose," he continues. "But sometimes that can be as simple as not allowing work to have outsize importance in your life, stepping back and wondering what you can get from the rest of your life that has meaning. I like most parts of my personality, and I have warm, trusting <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a46209424/relationship-chemistry/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=relationships class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">relationships</a>. These are such essential components of my life."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Work was not meant to be our only saviour when it comes to our purpose in life"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Flourishing in life means enjoying it, participating in it and feeling more connected to it. To achieve this, Keyes believes we should check in with ourselves and identify <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a46174034/set-priorities-method/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="what we would like more of" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">what we would like more of</a> in order to achieve that. Chief among that is connection with others, ensuring that you feel less alone, setting boundaries to carve out more time for yourself and, crucially, not being so hard on yourself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Keyes also hopes that more and more workplaces will start identifying and thus, guarding against, languishing. "A flourishing workplace is a successful one," he says. "I hope we start understanding that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Languishing’ by Dr Corey Keyes (£20, Transworld) is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/languishing/corey-keyes/9781911709589 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="out now." data-vars-ga-product-id=0779e22c-8e2a-4093-8c51-e900493eb827 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.waterstones.com/book/languishing/corey-keyes/9781911709589 data-product-url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/languishing/corey-keyes/9781911709589 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Flanguishing%2Fcorey-keyes%2F9781911709589" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=27cd7c22-97b6-4706-8549-da9861570894 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">out now.</a></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwvMSop6WdXaWus8DInqpompGvrqK%2BjJqrZq%2Bfp7hwrZNvbnJwZGp9cLjAp56uoaOdtq%2BzjJqrZq%2Bfp7hw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-coraci-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Coraci Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./324500-everything-tory-lanez-alleges-in-daystar-lyrics-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Everything Tory Lanez Alleges In &amp;quot;Daystar&amp;quot; Lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
