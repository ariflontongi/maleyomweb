ABC News interviewer&nbsp;Juju Chang’s takeaway after the sit-down was, “It’s a head-scratcher.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">One day before the pretaped and live finale aired on the After the Final Rose special — where the giddy senior couple, aged 72 for Turner and 70 for Nist, would go on to tell the world just how over-the-moon in love they were — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;published a report that raised questions about Turner’s past. On the show, Turner said he hadn’t dated anyone since the death of his first wife. In the story, however, a woman, who requested anonymity, identified herself as Turner’s ex-girlfriend and said they dated for more than two years.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>When asked about the story</a>&nbsp;during post-finale press, Turner acknowledged “there’s just enough truth in [the article]” but brushed it off as not fitting “with all of the positive things that are going on in my life right now.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When speaking Friday on GMA, Nist insisted that those late-in-the-game revelations and the reporting that also questioned his résumé, did not play a part in their split.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Gerry had already discussed that with me. He had explained it before the report was ever released, so we were good with that. It didn’t play into it,” said Nist.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The couple, who were all smiles and even ended their interview by saying they still love one another, put it simply: “We’ve come to the conclusion mutually that it’s probably time for us to dissolve our marriage,” said Turner. “I root for her every day.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Confirming that means they will be getting a divorce, he added, “We just feel like it’s best for the happiness of each of us to live apart.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Acknowledging that this blows up their previously shared plans for Nist to move to South Carolina with Turner, Nist said, “We looked at home after home, but we never got to the point where we made that decision.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Nist and Turner said their decision to speak now was because they didn’t want to pretend and let it play out only for the fans, which means they will be returning the ring gifted by the show. (Chang confirmed after the interview that a prenuptial agreement was also in place.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Nist and Turner insist they are still not giving up on love. “Don’t give up. Stay hopeful,” said Nist to anyone searching for a second or third chance at love, no matter what age — which will include the upcoming <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/the-golden-bachelorette-abc-gerry-turner-1235704668/>Golden Bachelorette</a> lead, another Bachelor spinoff series that was greenlit after The Golden Bachelor proved to be a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/tv-ratings-thursday-nov-30-2023-1235708069/>ratings smash</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I still love you,” they each said to each other before he kissed her hands.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A head-scratcher, indeed.
