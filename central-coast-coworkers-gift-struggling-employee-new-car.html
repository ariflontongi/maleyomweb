Come and live with us,” he said as the young man stood in disbelief.</p><p>Mr Taylor, who organised the touching gesture, later said the young man had lived a tough life, in and out of foster homes, and always struggled to get ahead despite his hard work.</p><p>“He is a beautiful person … Me and my wife had an idea and we put it to my bosses, we went dollar for dollar and gave him a Christmas gift and long-awaited helping hand,” he said.</p><p>“In doing so, we changed his life and took away a lot of stress.”</p><p>Trent McWaide, Managing Director of Roadsmart Fleet Steel River, an industrial tyre shop servicing The Central Coast and surrounds, was among the colleagues to chip in.</p><p>“Our aim was to give him a family – to let him know that we all care about him and he’s always got a family in us,” Mr McWaide told news.com.au.</p><p>He said the young worker had gone above and beyond in the workplace and asked for little in return.</p><p>“The car and other items that we gave him are just a physical acknowledgment of our love and support for him and to give him the confidence moving forward that people care about him,” he said.</p><p>“He’s worked so hard since he has been employed by us. It just goes to show that if you have a crack in life, things somehow have a way of figuring themselves out.</p><p>“What has impressed me most about this is how he has reacted to the gift … that just tells you the type of person he is.</p><p>“It’s wasn’t about the car or other items. It was about the opportunity he’s been given.”</p><p>Mr McWaide hopes others in the position to give this holiday period would consider doing the same.</p><p>“I hope this story can give someone hope this Christmas. If that’s the case, job done,” he said.</p><p>A version of the video shared on social media captured hundreds of thousands of hearts in just hours, quickly going viral.</p><p>Some said it was apparent how grateful the young was for his co-workers’ generous act.</p><p>“I love that instead of going to the car, he went straight in for the hugs! True appreciation,” one observed.</p><p>“Grateful young man who went straight in for the hug,” said another.</p><p>Others praised what was shown to be a caring workplace.</p><p>“Incredible … what an amazing company. Definitely a family,” one person exclaimed.</p><p>Another added: “You’ve changed his life”.</p><p>Others said the clip had left them in tears.</p><p>“I’m not crying – you’re crying,” said one commenter.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Another shared: “7:45am in the morning and I’m crying – absolutely beautiful.”</p><p>Mr McWaide told news.com.au he was immensely proud of the workplace culture his workers had created.</p><p><b><i>Share your acts of kindness – jack.evans@news.com.au</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmny4u9GkZpqsXay8s7eOnJynrKKWuW6vzpqqrWWTpMSwvsqeqaxll56ztXnSramun5ehtq%2BzjJ6kqaSfrrKmec2ermabkad8r7HWrGSsrJ%2BnxnB9k5qYcZuWbX%2BifMSdbptpkZh%2Ben2Ym2hrb2KZf3qEkA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sammi-kane-kraft-movie-actress-net-worth-219302.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sammi Kane Kraft Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./230445-rick-ross-baby-mama-evicted-from-store-after-failing-to-pay-rent-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rick Ross' Baby Mama Evicted From Store After Failing To Pay Rent</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
