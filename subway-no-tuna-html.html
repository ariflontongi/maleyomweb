Two San Francisco customers have filed a lawsuit in federal court, stating that Subway is misrepresenting its tuna sandwich, saying that Subway’s tuna does not, in fact, contain any tuna at all.</p><p>Karen Dhanowa and Nilima Amin, the pair who filed the claim, state that they were “tricked into buying food items that wholly lacked the ingredients they reasonably thought they were purchasing.” Alex Brown, the attorney with the Lanier Law Firm, which is representing Dhanowa and Amin, stated that they were trying to determine what the product is if it’s not tuna. Brown told <a href=#>CBS MoneyWatch</a>, “The lab tests thus far have only told us what it isn’t.” Subway’s <a href=#>website</a> claims that this substance is flaked tuna blended with creamy mayo. Nothing says appetizing like blended fish!</p><p>According to CBS News, if the case is seen as class-action, the suit would represent thousands of customers who had purchased tuna products in California since January 21, 2017. California currently has 2,266 locations. That’s a lot of possibly faux tuna. Subway has told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> that their tuna comes from real fish caught in the wild, and that these claims are “meritless.” Dhanowa and Amin claim that Subway is saving money by giving customers a fabricated product in place of tuna, and that they were cheated out of the health benefits that come from tuna due to this false fish substitute.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tuna-fish-954073_1280-900x608.jpg><p>This is just one of several lawsuits against Subway in recent years, claiming the sandwich chain is lying about their products. Back in 2017, a class-action <a href=#>settlement</a> was thrown out over claims that Subway’s footlong subs were actually only 11 inches. Last year, Ireland’s Supreme Court found that considering the amount of sugar content within Subway’s bread, the loaves could not be legally defined as <a href=#>bread</a>. Come to Subway, where you can eat an 11-inch sub that claims to be a footlong, with tuna fish that supposedly doesn’t contain fish, on bread that can’t even be considered bread.</p><p>In fact, Subway has had to support their <a href=#>meats</a> in the past against claims that they aren’t what they say they are. When several fast-food restaurants had their chicken DNA tested by the Canadian Broadcast Corporation’s Marketplace series, it was found that Subway’s oven-roasted chicken only contained 53.6% chicken DNA. With their chicken strips, the percentage was even lower, containing only 42.8% chicken DNA. The other restaurants tested ranged between 89.4% and 88.5% chicken DNA. Subway sued the CBC for a $210 million defamation lawsuit, with the Ontario Supreme Court siding with the CBC. No word yet on if Subway plans a similar defamation lawsuit against these tuna claims.</p><p>With so many claims coming against Subway, it’s hard to know what in the restaurant is actually real. Bread and various meats are already suspicious, what about cheese and vegetables? At this point, are the employees even real, or could they potentially be robots controlled by tuna, trying to avoid their brothers from being captured and eaten by Jared Fogle? Only time will tell what others secrets might lie within the Subway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tno6qvuK3YZqWoZaSqu6J6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teddy-park-net-worth-187893.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teddy Park Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1472222-someones-mum-woman-refuses-keep-her-arms-she-does-buga-challenge-a-bus-video-emerges.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Someone's Mum: Woman Refuses to Keep Her Arms down as She Does Buga Challenge inside a Bus, Video Em</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
