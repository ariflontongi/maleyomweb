On Wednesday, the actor shared with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a> that, despite his daughter’s young age of two, he feels she is growing up fast and is his number one supporter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's beautiful, she's growing fast, big, strong and healthy. And you can't be more blessed than that," Bloom told the outlet through his partnership with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Form Nutrition</a>. "And literally, I kid you not, she's like, 'Daddy, can I have a smoothie?' You know what she gets? She gets Form. We are very blessed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bloom and Katy Perry welcomed their first child together, Daisy Dove, on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aug. 26, 2020</a>, and ever since, they have been a united force through thick and thin. Bloom credits his fiancée as his "biggest fan" and support system.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think we support each other because we are fans of one another, you know what I mean?," he told the publication. "What she does is so empowering for young musicians with everything with [American] Idol. Then she can go and put on a powerhouse show in Vegas. We support, it's who we are. Katy's a force and we both have these pools we swim in, and we recognize each other's pools and we go, 'Hey, I'm over here. We're doing this.' And it's great."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from being a proud father of two (he shares son Flynn with his ex-wife, Miranda Kerr), Bloom is adding Chief Wellness Officer to his list of accolades. He’s teamed up with the aforementioned nutrition brand to launch the company's sustainable, plant-based protein powder and vegan multivitamins in the United States. And who better to lead the initiative than Bloom who always makes wellness a priority.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tristan Kallas</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have a daily routine and part of that is I work out, I try to move my body every day. I try to have a positive attitude towards that and health and wellness at all times," Bloom said. "I have a great list of recipes for how I like to use Form in my daily routine and just a flavor thing as much as it is a product. It's simply a product that I really love and enjoy and I'm seeing the results. I see the results in the gym, I see the results in my life, I see the results in my well-being, in my mental health."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zqujmqaUpHqjuM6opGajkamybrzEq6myZZKhsrS%2FxJ1knZmlnLW1sdFmbmttZW2CeQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1514402-presidency-fear-grips-pdp-atiku-tinubus-daughter-visit-influential-northern-elder-details-photo-emerge.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Presidency: Fear Grips PDP, Atiku as Tinubus Daughter Visit Influential Northern Elder, Details,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1590576-track-dbanj-don-jazzy-link-lovely-photos-fans-beg-music.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>One More Track: Dbanj and Don Jazzy Link Up in Lovely Photos, Fans Beg Them for New Music</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
