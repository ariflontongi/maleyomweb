This article delves into the full story of what happened to Gorilla Glue Girl, her journey to recovery, and the aftermath of her viral fame.</p><h2 id=the-viral-incident-YWURWcfIFz>The Viral Incident</h2><p>It all started when Tessica Brown, a 40-year-old woman from Louisiana, took to TikTok to share her hair dilemma.
