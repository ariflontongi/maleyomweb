There was a network but at a limited extent.”</p><p>Hansen studied law before he served as a Catholic priest in the Melbourne Archdiocese between 1996 and 2011.</p><p>He was arrested on arrival into Sydney from Singapore in 2018 and has been in custody ever since.</p><p>Among the more than 100,000 files police discovered on his electronic devices were videos and pictures of young boys lying naked on beds or in bathtubs, sometimes in groups or masturbating.</p><p>Some of the material had been downloaded as early as 2008.</p><p>It was all carefully filed under categories specifying where the material was filmed, what child was shown and acts depicted.</p><p>At a sentencing hearing in February, Hansen told the court he was “ashamed” of himself, saying he had fallen short of his own standards.</p><p>He sat solemnly throughout his two-day sentencing as appeared on screen in court from Goulburn jail wearing glasses and a prison-issue green bomber jacket.</p><p>With time served, Hansen will be eligible for parole in October 2032.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGSwsMHRrapmpJGsfLGx056pZpmemb%2Bmw4yhmKerlaN6psTPq6Ceq6RiuaKuzqtkqJ6WnrCqrctmoZqhnJqxbrLOq2RqcV2usqK%2B0madqKpdmLWquMNmnLGonKS2ta3ToqanZ56axLR50q2mq7FfaH15spNunZqcY5l%2Fcn6Ym2tvnGJsf3atkG%2BZbXCWbII%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-nemeth-urged-brother-dolph-ziggler-to-depart-wwe-for-over-a-decade.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Nemeth Urged Brother Dolph Ziggler to Depart WWE for Over a Decade</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./231496-nike-waffle-racing-moon-shoe-goes-for-s437k-at-auction-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nike Waffle Racing &amp;quot;Moon Shoe&amp;quot; Goes For $437K At Auction</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
