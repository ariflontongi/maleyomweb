Of course, the men she was involved with throughout her career didn't always treat her the way she deserved. She famously spent time with Biggie Smalls <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">throughout the 90s</a> and has been linked to names like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ray J</a>, Scott Storch, Benzino, and Sean Combs. It's clear that Kim has a preference for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fellow creative types</a>. However, it seems she's making changes in her dating life these days, notably stepping out of her age group.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As Vibe reports, it seems the blonde beauty might be shacking up with her signee, Tayy Brown. Hip-hop heads began speculating after seeing their chemistry in the "Love For Ya" visual, but now that she's wished her man a belated happy birthday with an extra sappy post, there's even more reason to believe Kim is being romanced by a younger gentleman.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-kim-and-tayy-brown-collaborate-on-love-for-ya>Lil Kim and Tayy Brown Collaborate on "Love For Ya"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I know this post is a little late, but I was blessed enough to spend [your] whole birthday with [you] and we're still celebrating üçæü•ÇüíÉüï∫," Kim wrote to her recent collaborator on Instagram this week. "Our bond is so perfectly matched in the most organic way. I know it was God that brought us [together]. If [people] only knew how big of a role [you] play in my life and in my career," she continued to gush under a few videos of their cute moments together.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-queen-bee-celebrates-her-rumoured-beau-after-his-birthday>Queen Bee Celebrates Her Rumoured Beau After His Birthday</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lil Kim then praised Tayy Brown for encouraging her to deliver new music to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her Beehive</a>. "[You] are my motivation and that voice that is always cheering me on. [You're] so intelligent and such a boss. If they only knew the things we figure out [together], how we can talk with our eyes and be on the same page," her birthday tribute reads. Though her alleged lover "gets on [her] nerves sometimes," she takes great pleasure in annoying him back. Do you think Kim has found a solid companion in TB?
