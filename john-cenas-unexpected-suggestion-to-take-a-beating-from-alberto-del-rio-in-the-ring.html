While Cena was a highly divisive figure in WWE, there were many that respected him in the company. Now it appears that he even pitched getting squashed by Alberto Del Rio in WWE.</p><p>John Cena is a 16-time World Champion and has accomplished everyone a pro wrestler would ever want in his career. That said, there were many people who simply hated John Cena.</p><p>This was mostly during the time he was in his ‘Super Cena’ phase, where Cena seldom lost a match and was accused of burying talent. John Cena himself&nbsp;addressed his reputation for burying talent a while ago.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Alberto Del Rio defeated John Cena at WWE Hell In A Cell in 2015 and became the United States Champion. This was after Del Rio was released in 2014 under controversial circumstances.</p><p>While speaking to Sportskeeda Wrestling’s Riju Dasgupta, Alberto Del Rio revealed that John Cena pitched to lose to Del Rio in just two minutes after Del Rio returned to WWE that year.</p><p>“I learned that [how to have fun] from him, and it was him that night in the Staples Center telling Vince, ‘No, no, no. No, El Presidente is coming back, and we owe him that for what happened with the social media guy. So, no, two minutes.’ I couldn’t believe it. I was like, ‘Are you sure, John?’ ‘Okay.’ So, thank you, John, for that moment. Thank you, WWE. Thank you, Vince, Paul [Levesque, aka Triple H], and everybody involved for bringing me back.”</p><p>Alberto Del Rio is also certain&nbsp;<a href=#>he will get inducted into the WWE Hall Of Fame someday</a>. Regardless, only time will tell whether Del Rio ends up in WWE again after his departure back in 2016.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Alberto Del Rio said?
