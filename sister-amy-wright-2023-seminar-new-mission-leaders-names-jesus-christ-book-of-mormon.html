Sister Wright’s address focused on what individuals learn about Christlike attributes from the names Book of Mormon prophets used for the Savior.</p><h3>Moroni — faith in Jesus Christ</h3><p>Sister Wright said in a world filled with hatred, sin and war, “Moroni repeatedly beckons us to come unto Jesus Christ. … [He] is indicating this is not merely a promising idea but exactly what we need to do!” (See <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Mormon 9:37,</a> <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Ether 12:41</a> and <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Moroni 10:30</a>.)</p><h3>Lehi — hope</h3><p>Lehi spoke intimately and poetically about the Savior’s love, Sister Wright said, referring to Him as the Messiah.</p><p>It’s no wonder that Lehi, who anguished over the disobedience of his people and his children, testified of a Messiah who would restore the fallen, lost and broken, she continued.</p><p>Knowledge of the Messiah gave Lehi “great hope,” Sister Wright said. (See <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Moroni 7:42</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/43a1e14/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1365+0+0/resize/730x487!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FRjtgqpRKi7k9ucgbHLiYC6Qhklk%3D%2F0x0%3A2048x1365%2F2048x1365%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281024x683%3A1025x684%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24749395%2F20230622_090934_CPowell_CEP6574.jpg"><h3>Mormon — charity and love</h3><p>Mormon spoke of Jesus as the Savior “in connection with the redemption of the Israelites and most powerfully in the salvation of little children,” Sister Wright said. (See <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>3 Nephi 5:20</a>, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>26</a> and <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Moroni 8:8</a>.)</p><p>To Mormon, the title “Savior” seems to have epitomized <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>charity and love</a>, she added.</p><h3>Jacob — virtue</h3><p>Jacob repeatedly called Jesus <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>the Holy One of Israel</a>. This is noteworthy considering Jacob’s temple responsibilities, Sister Wright said.</p><p>“The purpose of temple sacrifice and service in ancient Israel was to purify the people,” she said. “... As the true unblemished lamb, the Holy One of Israel personifies virtue.”</p><h3>King Benjamin — integrity</h3><p>King Benjamin’s devotion to God shows in how he referred to Jesus as <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Lord Omnipotent</a>.</p><p>“To King Benjamin, ‘Lord Omnipotent’ may have symbolized righteous governance founded on the attribute of integrity,” Sister Wright said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a3a4441/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x1131+0+0/resize/730x516!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FZAPZzK8U9CyN6D6lJJu7fJzLlgM%3D%2F0x0%3A1600x1131%2F1600x1131%2Ffilters%3Afocal%28800x566%3A801x567%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F23809124%2Fking_benjamin_addresses_people_39650_print.jpeg"><h3>Alma the Younger — knowledge</h3><p>Alma the Younger used many names for Jesus, but one that possibly resonated with his leadership responsibilities was <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>“Shepherd,”</a> Sister Wright said.</p><p>“Alma the Younger seems to have learned from the Good Shepherd that a righteous leader consistently seeks to nourish his sheep with truth and knowledge,” Sister Wright said.</p><h3>Samuel the Lamanite — patience</h3><p>Sister Wright said Samuel the Lamanite faced “fierce opposition,” so it makes sense that he called Jesus the <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Lord of Hosts.</a></p><p>“This title speaks of His role as the head of the hosts, or the leader of a battle,” Sister Wright said. “... Amidst the battle of good and evil, Samuel, like Jesus, demonstrated great patience for the wicked and continued to invite them to soften their hearts, repent and keep His commandments.”</p><h3>Abinadi — humility</h3><p>Abinadi stood alone in preaching, in bearing persecution and in his martyrdom by fire, Sister Wright said.</p><p>Perhaps this is why Abinadi referred to Jesus as <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>“the Son,” </a>Sister Wright said. As the Only Begotten Son, Jesus stood alone in submitting to His Father’s will.</p><p>“Submission comes from a place of humility. From the ever-obedient Son of the Eternal Father, Abinadi learned the true meaning of humility,” Sister Wright said.</p><h3>Nephi — diligence</h3><p>Nephi was often persecuted by his own brothers for his righteousness, Sister Wright said. Despite this, he was diligent in following the Lord.</p><p>It’s no wonder that Nephi called Jesus “<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>the Lamb of God,</a>” Sister Wright continued.</p><p>“As the Lamb of God, Jesus was willing to submit to the will of His Father,” Sister Wright said. “... He set the perfect example of diligence and did so with significant effort and care.”</p><h3>Amulek — obedience</h3><p>Amulek sacrificed his wealth and family relationships for the word of God, Sister Wright said. Despite this, Amulek called Jesus “<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>the Son of God.</a>”</p><p>“Portraying Christ in His familial relationship with the Father may have been especially sensitive to Amulek,” she said. “... [But] to Amulek, the Son of God epitomized obedience.”</p><h3>Building valiant testimonies</h3><p>Sister Wright said she hopes missionaries will seek Jesus throughout their missions and after.</p><p>“As missionaries strive to develop His Christlike attributes, I testify that they will have experiences with their Savior … that are so deeply profound and personal they will choose to be valiant in their testimonies all the days of their lives,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVfobKisMSrqmhqYGeAcIKOa2poamNshHGDk2lmrKGjqbKzecCmsGavop60qcCMa2dra12osq61zZqpZqaVrHqutdKsoKimXaGyorDEq6pmppGisrR5yZ6qrqtdmLWztdKtZJunn6B6sLKMpqarpZ%2Bj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leonardo-dicaprio-kate-winslet-date-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet ever date?
