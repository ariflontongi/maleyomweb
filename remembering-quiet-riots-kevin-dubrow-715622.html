Now a plastic surgeon with his own jaw-dropping reality show — E!’s Botched (moving to the post-Kardashian 10 p.m. slot on June 29), co-starring <strong>Paul Nassif</strong>, a househusband formerly of the Beverly Hills edition —&nbsp;Dubrow keeps his late siblings’ memory alive by displaying rows of platinum albums in his tony Newport Beach home and speaking of him as often as he can. “I will never forget the day I came home from med school at UCLA and there was a message from my mom [saying], “Your brother’s album is No. 1,” Dubrow recalls. “No. 2 was Thriller and No. 3 was <strong>Lionel Richie</strong>. It was huge.”</p><p>Growing up, the two siblings were close. As Terry Dubrow recalls: “We lived in a two-bedroom apartment, and I shared a room with Kevin, who was three years older than me. I had a little desk where I would be studying my mathematics, and there were pictures of <strong>Roger Daltrey</strong>, <strong>Jimi Hendrix</strong> and <strong>Eric Clapton</strong>. … He had a drum set in there.”</p><p><strong>STORY <a href=#>Plastic Surgery Suicide Puts Spotlight on Beverly Hills Patients’ Desperation, Lies and Mental States</a></strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Quiet%20Riot%20Metal%20Health%20cover%20S.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Upon Dubrow’s death — he was found dead in his Las Vegas Home on Nov. 25, 2007, at the age of 52 — his brother and mother gathered his possessions, and that was when Terry Dubrow decided to bring the platinum records home. “We thought we would display them prominently in our house in his memory and his honor,” says Dubrow. “It is something we hold in high regard. It’s great that my four children know that their uncle was a big-time rock star.”</p><p>Even after decades of chanting “Bang Your Head,” Dubrow insists his older bro “didn’t need plastic surgery.” As for the unfortunate ones who come to Botched asking to look like <strong>Justin Bieber</strong>: “It’s a cautionary tale,” he says.</p><p>Curiously, Dubrow isn’t the only Real Housewives alum with a music-business connection.&nbsp;<strong>Lisa</strong> <strong>Vanderpump</strong>, of Beverly Hills fame, starred in the video for ABC’s 1985 hit, “Poison Arrow,” while <strong>David</strong> <strong>Foster</strong>‘s wife, <strong>Yolonda</strong>, is featured on the Beverly Hills edition. But Atlanta’s <strong>Kandi</strong> <strong>Burruss</strong>, a Grammy-winning songwriter with credits on TLC’s hit “No Scubs” and Destiny’s Child’s “Bills, Bills, Bills,” takes top prize; her wedding special drew 2.6 million viewers to Bravo on June 22.</p><p>Twitter: <a href=# rel=nofollow>@micheleamabile</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2Bnsq6xzJucq6GenHqywcieq2aqmaTBtHnKnq2ipl2ZwqO%2BzrBkcGlla39zew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robin-lopez-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robin Lopez Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./r6-siege-y6s4-thorn-release-date-unique-gadget-weapons-loadout-and-role.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>R6 Siege Thorn guide: Release date, unique gadget, weapons, loadout, and role</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
