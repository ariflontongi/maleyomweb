It just means that it feels like I have to fight for my life on a daily basis as I attempt to keep up with all the news, take the time to test products out, and decide what's actually worth sharing with readers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, when it comes to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Rose Ingleton MD</a> products, as soon as I get my sample in the mail, I pretty much already know that it'll be efficacious. However, I wasn't expecting to be as blown away as I was by the brand's latest launch: the SuperFruit Exfoliating Tonic — and trust me, I am not one to be easily impressed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I first started using the tonic, I was finishing a retinol I had been using for the past few months. So, in order to incorporate the new product into my routine without burning my face to ashes, I was using each of them separately and switching one out for the next every other night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But man, I have to be real: after about a week of using the liquid exfoliant, I was dying for my retinol to finish so I could toss the empty bottle and make Dr. Rose Ingleton's latest product my main squeeze. And truth be told, a few other toners and serums now needed to go into the trash with it. Not because there was anything necessarily wrong with them, but because the SuperFruit Exfoliating Tonic basically just made them obsolete (and I wanted more space on my vanity, so sorry to those products!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After weeks of testing, I noticed the Exfoliating Tonic had made my skin crazy soft, smooth, and next level glowy rather quickly. But the true test came when a new supplement I was taking — coupled with the horrific hard water I was forced to wash my face with while I was out of town — made me breakout, then left behind subsequent dark spots and all other types of nonsense on my face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I kid you not, within a week of my skin freaking out, the tonic completely turned my complexion around. The dark spots on my forehead had basically disappeared, the newer ones on my cheeks had dramatically diminished, and no new bumps have even bothered to show up since. (Full disclosure: I am also using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Sunday Riley's C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum</a> during the day, but the tonic 3000% sped things up.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With an 8% glycolic acid complex, blended with licorice root extract, aloe vera, Dr. Ingleton's Jamaican SuperFruit Blend, and likely some type of sorcery, it's easy to see why this product is as effective as it is and why it's become a staple in my routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Ask Dr. Pimple Popper</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typically, I don't double up on products from the same line in order to keep up with testing and give each brand a fair shot. But man, Dr. Ingleton's products have single-handedly taken over a huge chunk of my routine. (Go try the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>SuperFruit Brightening Cleanser</a> if you haven't already.) And while this technically goes against my rules, my skin would have it no other way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Splurge</a> is our recurring column dedicated to expensive beauty products that are worth it.
