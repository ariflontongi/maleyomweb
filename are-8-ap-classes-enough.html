But even so, taking 4 AP courses in a year can be extremely challenging. You're better off spreading the course load over as many years of high school as possible, so you can limit yourself to at most 2–3 AP courses in a year.<h2>Can you take 8 APs?</h2>Most top schools would like to see you take at a minimum say 5-8 APs and score mostly 4s and 5s on the exams. If your school offers a 20-30 AP courses and you have a lot of stiff competition I would try to take 8-12. That's a pretty full load considering you can only take APs in 11th/12th at your school.<h2>How many AP classes is normal?</h2>While there are 38 total AP classes and exams offered worldwide, it's completely unreasonable to expect a student to take that many (or even half that many) AP courses.

Harvard confers 4 or 8 credits for eac eligible AP exam depending on whether the exam covers one semester or one full year's worth of material.<h2>Can I get into Harvard without AP classes?</h2>In other words, if you have credit from your AP tests, IB exams, or dual credit classes in high school, you will not be granted credit at Harvard.
