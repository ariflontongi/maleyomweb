Notably, she threw quite a bit of shade at <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>, who she's had her fair share of differences with in the past. She didn't call her out by name, but a mention of "Megan's Law," a law that requires authorities to notify the public of sex offenders in their area, made it pretty clear who she was talking about.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As expected, she and the Barbz have fired back with full force, leading to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">online chaos</a> and even an upcoming response track from Nicki, "Big Foot." As the two rap divas' fanbases spar on social media, #BigFoot trends on Twitter, and Nicki likes shady posts about Meg, the Houston MC has stayed mostly silent.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-megan-thee-stallion-discusses-hiss>Megan Thee Stallion Discusses "Hiss"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She did recently call into The Breakfast Club, however, chatting with Charlamagne Tha God and DJ Envy about the single. During their conversation, Meg reiterated that the song is a warning. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"It's basically telling you to back off,"</a> she described. "I hear you, I see you, back up off me now." When Charlamagne asked her to clarify whether she named any names, she noted that she didn't. She went on to suggest that the track is actually aimed at multiple people. "Whoever feel it feel it," she said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meg also mentioned that she doesn't have social media on her phone, leaving her unbothered by the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">inevitable "smoke</a>." "They're gonna act like it's unprovoked. I'm gonna take a little nap, and I'll wake back up to see what they have to say," she explained.
