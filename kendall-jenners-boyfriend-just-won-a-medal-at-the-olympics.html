Fortunately, the <a href=#>"Keeping Up With the Kardashians"</a>&nbsp;star can still relish in the momentous celebrations considering <a href=#>her boyfriend Devin Booker</a>&nbsp;is an athlete in the <a href=#>2021 Tokyo Olympics</a>. Booker, a professional NBA basketball player for the Phoenix Suns, made his Olympic debut for the USA Men's team alongside fellow superstars Kevin Durant, Jerami Grant, and Bam Adebayo against France during the legendary games in late July, per <a href=#>AZ Central</a>.</p><p>Jenner may not be front and center at Booker's games in Tokyo, but the supermodel loves cheering her man on at his more local events. <a href=#>E! News</a> reported Jenner was spotted attending Booker's NBA Finals on July 17 in Phoenix, where she seemed "really engaged in the game," an eyewitness told the outlet. "She would stand up and cheer every time Devin scored. It was so cute! She held her hands on her head at the end of the first quarter."</p><p>When <a href=#>Jenner and Booker first started dating</a>&nbsp;in June 2020, the two were extremely <a href=#>tight-lipped about sharing details of their romance</a>. However, after multiple public appearances, she's slowly started posting pics of the pair on Instagram. Most recently, Jenner showcased her love for her beau by celebrating his win at the Olympics. Keep scrolling for more on the brunette bombshell's reaction to Booker's medal.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kendall Jenner posts a rare social media tribute to boyfriend Devin Booker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/kendall-jenners-boyfriend-just-won-a-medal-at-the-olympics/kendall-jenner-posts-a-rare-social-media-tribute-to-boyfriend-devin-booker-1628449352.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Shutterstock, Mike Coppola/Getty Images</span><p>So proud of her honey! Kendall Jenner congratulated her boyfriend&nbsp;<a href=#>Devin Booker</a>&nbsp;following his gold medal win in the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo. Posting a photo of the Michigan native, taken from behind while on the court following team USA's victory, the fashion model simply captioned the Instagram Story with a gold medal emoji (via <a href=#>Page Six</a>). Booker and his teammates earned the fourth straight gold medal for the USA, defeating France in the finals with a score of 87 to 82.</p><p>Jenner and the handsome hunk haven't flaunted their relationship much since becoming a couple last summer, but "this is the happiest Kendall has been in a relationship," an insider told <a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;in April 2021. "It's getting more and more serious and she is very happy." Fortunately for the socialite, her family — including matriarch Kris Jenner — "loves him and knows how good they are for one another," another source told the outlet.</p><p>"They love having Devin around and have welcomed him with open arms," the E! insider continued, noting Jenner's bond with Booker is different. Her past boyfriends include Ben Simmons, <a href=#>Blake Griffin</a>, and A$AP Rocky (via <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>). "They love seeing Kendall so happy with someone who brings out the best in her. It's exciting for everyone to see her in such a great relationship."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXBhbX51e8qepZ2ZnKF6q7HNp5yrq12XvLqy0aKcp5xdn8K0wIywpqdlkWK6prDApWSarF2ptaZ5zqWwpqiZmMBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1485940-king-cids-biography-age-height-real-girlfriend-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>King Cids biography: age, height, real name, girlfriend, net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keely-shaye-husband-pierce-brosnan-still-swoon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keely Shaye reveals husband Pierce Brosnan still makes her 'swoon' in romantic tribute</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
