It then formally filed its reorganization&nbsp;plan&nbsp;in April 2023, which aimed to cut the firm’s debt by about $4.53 billion, mainly through lenders getting equity in the reorganized group in exchange for releasing their claims. The Chapter 11 filing followed Cineworld failing to find buyers for some or all of its exhibition assets.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Today, the second-biggest movie cinema chain behind AMC Theatres looks well clear of that pandemic-era cliff, having greatly lightened its debt load as it rides Hollywood’s box office recovery. That’s in part by turbocharging the theatrical movie experience with premium moviegoing experiences like the 4DX auditorium in Manhattan opening this weekend.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We believe customers want a differentiation and a reason to come out of their houses to see movies. So to me this feels really important, this shows how bullish we are for the industry and how we are ready to be better and grow bigger,” Acuna said. (The exec replaced former Cineworld CEO Moshe “Mooky” Greidinger under the company’s new ownership unveiledin July 2023.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As the streaming era takes hold with consumers, exhibitors have fallen back on touting the exalted role of the communal movie experience that the multiplex has long offered. And the 4DX theater promises the combination of on-screen visuals with synchronized motion seats and other sensory effects like wind, rain, snow, fog and lightning.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Regal currently has 49 4DX theaters and another 52 Screenx auditoriums in the U.S. market. Acuna forecast Regal will invest in around another 50 4DX and Screenx theaters in future years. “We’re at a point where we came through some tough times, but we’re also ready to invest,” he added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Besides Regal, CJ 4DPLEX has 62 4DX theaters and 29 ScreenX theaters with Cineworld and CCI across Europe and Israel. Don Savant, CEO and president of CJ 4DPLEX America, said the 4DX technology is also playing well in U.S. rural markets where Regal is dominant.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We’re not just in LA, Chicago, San Francisco, New York … We’re really spread out,” Savant noted as he pointed to an average per-screen average of $937,000 per location across Regal’s 4DX screens.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But while back on its feet, Cineworld and the rest of the global exhibition sector is still down compared with the Hollywood box office of the pre-pandemic era. And comparisons to 2019’s record-breaking global box office are wide of the mark for Acuna.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I don’t like to say we haven’t gone back to 2019, because 2019 is the reference everybody uses and it was a record-breaking year. You can’t do record-breaking years every year,” Savant told THR.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I would argue our industry is on a clear path to growth and, even better, most companies are profitable. We at Regal have one of the healthiest balance sheets in the industry and we’re making money. We made money in 2023,” Acuna added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">With the film release calendar working out an uneven supply of movies to theaters in the wake of the dual strikes, Acuna did make some predictions for global box office this year and into 2025. “I see box office in 2024 being between $8 billion and $8.5 billion. I see 2025 rebounding to between $9 billion and $10 billion,” he predicted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Despite the industry being adrift of pre-pandemic box office levels, Acuna said exhibitors had gotten better at maximizing profits, in part from great concession sales and higher ticket prices. “The industry is quite healthy right now. And we’re getting healthier, and as more movies come, we’re going to be even better,” he argued.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But as audiences return to theaters and chains raise ticket prices, Acuna said exhibitors had to get more agile about ticket pricing. “I’m not confident that we can continue raising prices and I would actually change this conversation to saying we need to be better understanding the right price,” he noted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While insisting moviegoing was an affordable entertainment experience when compared to the cost of tickets for live concerts and sporting events, Acuna said inflation and the cost-of-living crisis in key global markets meant exhibitors weigh up how to reach cost-conscious consumers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We do need to look at pricing. There are some theaters where we may be able to get a little more pricing, but there are other complexes where a lower price may drive more attendance,” the CEO stated. “So exhibitors need to get smarter in understanding price elasticity for our customers, which is just plain economics, right?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmnKGemsSwvsudZJydn2KvorrKq6yprJOueqi%2BzrCroWVhZ4B2hJJxamxrXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./percy-jackson-disney-scobell-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See The Actor Cast As The New Percy Jackson</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-william-ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-wrexham-football.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince William Has a Childhood Connection to Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney's Wrexham Football Clu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
