He was the brother of Mad Dog Buzz Sawyer, although both are gone the stories will forever live on. My thoughts and prayers go out for his family, friends and fans during this difficult time!</p><p>Brett Sawyer, whose real name was Brett Woyan, was the sibling of the late Maddog Buzz Sawyer, who served as his trainer in the wrestling world. Together, the Sawyer brothers formed a tag team in Don Owens’ Pacific Northwest Wrestling during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Brett adopted the moniker “Hacksaw” during this period and enjoyed a successful career within the Portland territory. He secured the Pacific Northwest title on four occasions and claimed multiple Tag Team championships.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Beyond the Portland wrestling scene, Brett and Buzz engaged in a memorable feud with The Road Warriors, Hawk and Animal, in Georgia Championship Wrestling, vying for the NWA National Tag Team titles. In 1985 and 1986, Brett Sawyer competed in Jim Crockett Promotions, often teaming up with Buzz. Their wrestling journey also took them to New Japan Pro Wrestling in 1987. In the realm of Championship Wrestling from Florida, Sawyer formed a tag team partnership with Jim Backlund, later known as Jimmy Del Rey, under the moniker “The Playboys.” Additionally, he teamed up with Chicky Starr in Southwest Championship Wrestling.</p><p>As a solo competitor, Brett Wayne Sawyer held the Central States Wrestling Championship in Kansas City. During that time, he garnered a fan following on his own to prove himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Although his wrestling career concluded in 1998, Brett had recently begun making appearances at conventions, participating in autograph signings and photo sessions. His presence was felt at events like last month’s The Gathering III in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>We are sending our best to Brett Sawyer’s family, friends, and fans during this sad time.
