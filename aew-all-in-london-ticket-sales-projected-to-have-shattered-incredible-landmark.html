Booking Wembley Stadium paid off in a huge way, because tickets have flown out of the box office. Now, AEW has a huge flex on the entire planet. It seems that they might have already sold more tickets than even <a href=#>Chris Jericho reported.</a></p><p>Fans attacked All In London presale tickets with a passion, buying up 35k in one day, but that was only the beginning. Like Pepecoin, it seems to have shot up like a rocket, and that number is only growing.</p><p>Wrestle Tix broke down the current All In London ticket sales behind their paywall. In that nice write-up, they included a note that AEW’s big Wembley Stadium show has already sold 70k tickets.</p><p>If you’re curious where I’m at, I have them around 70K+ distributed. Just to repeat, that doesn’t mean 70K sold; it’s just where I landed at this moment when combing through the map.</p><p>The report also noted that, “the last available count I grabbed was 9,392. They opened up the rest of the stadium yesterday (the upper decks behind the hard cam area are all partially opened, along with some 200 level sections).”</p><p>It was also stated that, “it doesn’t mean 70K sold; it’s just where I landed at this moment when combing through the map. When I asked readers about several sections that I questioned (if opened), almost every section received responses (which means it’s hard to rule out some sections I thought for sure weren’t yet opened).”</p><p>Ticket sales is a tricky business, and it’s hard to draw interest in such a competitive climate. AEW certainly captured lightening in a bottle with All In London, because fans in the UK market are responding in a huge way for All Elite Wrestling’s first event in their territory.</p><p>AEW All In London has not been promoted as a pay-per-view event yet. It will be interesting to see if and when AEW addresses this, because it’s hard to imagine that they will keep it as a house show. After all, AEW All Out will follow the big Wembley Stadium event the next week.</p><p>What’s your take on AEW’s ticket sales for All In London? Will they totally sell out Wembley Stadium?
