Gripping, intense and thrilling from the start. Vicky McClure at her best. Can't wait to see where it goes next.” Another fan added: “As brilliant as I expected.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff -recommended-video"><span class=videoPlayerStyleHeader_v1l4r7u3>Recommended video</span><span class=videoPlayerStyleTitle_v1pm0z4u>You may also like</span>WATCH: Vicky McClure looks spellbinding for first dance with husband Jonathan Owen</figure><p id=eVoABsabPRi data-wc=58>A third person wrote: “Starting watching #insomnia and I'm hooked brilliant actress @Vicky_McClure." A third person critiqued: “#Insomnia Vicky McClure's new series has me very baffled. It has a very disturbing atmosphere in McClure, it is excellent, and I also like the looping narrative. I don't know where it will [go] but for now it has my attention.”&nbsp;</p><p id=em9GtIzdyhi data-wc=46>Critics were less enthusiastic, with iNews writing: “There was one element I didn’t see coming. To go into detail would be to give away too much about the finale but the ending felt more like a lazy cheat than a twist – more irritating than entertaining.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a423e23856af-ins10120231019de-417.jpg><p id=e8mCVxPIFGT data-wc=48>Digital Spy wrote: “The very serious-minded drama grasps at the straws of motherhood, women aging and childhood trauma, but there just isn't much there there. Insomnia feels most comfortable playing in the paddling pool of soapy storylines, rather than sinking into the deep waters of those Big Themes.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ePeAUomE-DQE data-wc=49>The Irish Times gave it a more positive review, writing: “McClure is great and underneath the pulp trappings, Insomnia explores, with a reasonable degree of seriousness, the challenge of ageing parents and of confronting parts of yourself that are beyond your control. It’s silly but gets under the skin.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/95f863ef053e-ins101-20231107-as101384.jpg><p id=ewew87pNRIhZ data-wc=88>So what is the show about? The story follows Vicky as Emma “who fears she might be losing her mind when her hard-won dream life starts to turn into a nightmare. A couple of weeks before her fortieth birthday, Emma stops sleeping — just as her mother had done right before she suffered a violent psychotic breakdown on the night of her own fortieth birthday. Emma’s mother always told her she’d go the same way, that she had the same “bad blood” and now Emma’s terrified it’s true”.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoBaax9WCBdX data-wc=40>The synopsis continues: “As events worsen, Emma’s world starts to unravel and she realises that only by investigating the truth of her painful past, can she find the answers to her present and prevent tragedy from striking a second time.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e77ba820875c-435271811180142291582602812719746866873544275n.jpg><p id=e08FfZKxnB3J data-wc=57>Speaking to Digital Spy about the role, Vicky said: “I turned 40 last year, she was turning 40 in the show. I was like, this is a sign. And then just the general difference in terms of the tone of the show and a character that I haven't really played before or for a very long time.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Vicky McClure’s bridal dress quest and standout second wedding look -" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/35f0bff49657-vicky-mcclure-engaged.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Vicky McClure’s bridal dress quest and standout second wedding look -" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Vicky McClure’s bridal dress quest and standout second wedding look -</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Vicky McClure stuns in flowing veil and shoulder-baring dress for wedding photo with father-of-the-bride" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/42d47f2a1ceb-vicky-mcclure-white.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Vicky McClure stuns in flowing veil and shoulder-baring dress for wedding photo with father-of-the-bride" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Vicky McClure stuns in flowing veil and shoulder-baring dress for wedding photo with father-of-the-bride</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e9PHlIKqtvpp data-wc=53>“Emma was dreading it and for good reasons.
