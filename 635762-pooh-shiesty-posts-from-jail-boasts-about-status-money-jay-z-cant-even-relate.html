It stemmed from a shooting in October 2020, but in June 2021, Shiesty was arrested for a separate incident. The rapper faced several charges, but in the end, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess a firearm in furtherance of violent and drug-trafficking crimes. Pooh was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sentenced to five years</a> behind bars, and he's remained relatively quiet—that is, until now.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Tuesday evening (February 21), Shiesty emerged on Instagram with a lengthy post. Unsurprisingly, the message was also quickly shared, and it looked as if the rapper was talking that talk from behind bars. He seemed more concerned with his street cred and Google's listing of his net worth. "King Shiesty tappin in from the middle of the pennititary aka Hell where they say i cant go , jailing no telling !!" he began. "I still remain Untouched , Millions still in double digits ! tell google fix my networth we can verify that sh*t right now."</p><span><h6><strong>Pooh Shiesty Boasts About His Status</strong></h6></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He continued: "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Yeah im locked up </a>not f*cked up. i was 21 up 8 figures jayZ cant even relate my money tripple my followers." Additionally, it seemed that Shiesty was upset with how certain people were speaking about him. "Stop playing with my name before i buy one of you for sale ass n*ggas you n*ggas ANYTHING! I put on for this Choppa Gang sh*t everyday. Twice on Sundays im on the same sh*t from Tokio to Tennesse."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After a bit more bragging, Shiesty had a message for those who have stood in his corner. "For my fans , supporters , love ones holding me down everyday," he said. "Keep keeping it solid i promise it dont get unnoticed i see everything and got some special for all word is law." However, he also had a scathing note for his foes.</p><span><h6 id=h-shiesty-has-words-for-his-enemies><strong>Shiesty Has Words For His Enemies</strong></h6></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"The rest of you pussies dead ! keep hating , false advertising , back biting , and counting me out, it up and stuck like a tree house," he further stated. "Im touching down to terrorize i gotta dorito on my shoulder im going 100% flamboyant on you f*cking clowns ! its all bad for you wild ass n*ggas ' ALL EYES ON SHIEST ' #NeverCheckedIn #SnitchK #No5k1 #Norule35 #Mr.Omerta."
