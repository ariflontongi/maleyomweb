To put that into perspective: parts of Italy are closer to the conflict zone. Sharm El Sheikh in <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>Egypt</a>, where holidays carry on as usual, is just over 100 miles away from Israel.</p><p>However, flights to Dubai may need to take alternative flight paths due to the conflict, and on October 29, 2023 the Foreign Office updated its advice regarding terrorism in the country.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about travel to Dubai and the rest of the UAE, whether it is safe to visit, and your rights if you do decide to cancel your upcoming holiday.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Is the UAE impacted by the Hamas–Israel conflict?</h2><p>To date, the UAE has not been impacted by the conflict.</p><p>On October 8, the UAE foreign ministry described the attacks carried out by Hamas on Israel as a “serious and grave escalation.”</p><p>“Civilians on both sides must always have full protection under international humanitarian law and must never be a target of conflict,” the ministry added.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Does the Foreign Office warn against travel to the UAE?</h2><p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has not issued any blanket advisories against travel to the UAE or Dubai. However, on October 29 the FCDO updated its advice regarding terrorism in the UAE.</p><p>“Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in the UAE. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners,” says the FCDO.</p><p>“Terrorists continue to issue statements threatening to carry out attacks in the Gulf region. These include references to attacks on western interests, including residential compounds, military, oil, transport and aviation interests as well as crowded places, including restaurants, hotels, beaches, shopping centres and mosques. You should maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in public places and at public events,” the FCDO adds.</p><p>“There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.”</p><p>The FCDO also warns of possible public disturbances and demonstrations: “Events in the Middle East can affect local public opinion. Follow news reports and be alert to local and regional developments, which might trigger public disturbances,” the FCDO advises.&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>THE FCDO advises to 'maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in public places and at public events'</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Moment RF/Getty</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Are flights still operating?</h2><p>Yes, flights are still operating to Dubai. It is likely that any airlines travelling from the UK to the UAE will take appropriate precautions to avoid Israeli airspace, routing instead over Egypt.&nbsp;</p><p>On October 17, an Emirates A380 flight from Dubai to Manchester was subject to extra security checks on landing and passengers were evacuated from part of the airport. After the aircraft was cleared, passengers disembarked as usual.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">What if I want to cancel my holiday?</h2><p>If you have booked a package holiday to Dubai, Abu Dhabi or anywhere else in the UAE and want to cancel your trip for any reason, contact your tour operator and they might offer flexibility with alternative dates.&nbsp;</p><p>But bear in mind that, because the Foreign Office has not issued any advice against travel to the UAE,&nbsp; there is no guarantee you will receive a refund, nor will you be able to claim money back with your travel insurance company.</p><p>If you have booked flights and accommodation independently, and wish to cancel your holiday, contact your travel providers as soon as possible to see if you can rearrange your plans. Note, however, that given the circumstances, it is unlikely you will receive a full refund.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6am6%2Bhk5p8qr%2BMoqtmq5Gbsm7CyKygrWWUqq%2BitYyumJ5llpixsHnTq5ivnZxirqXCyJycZqGjp66muIygmLOZXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1385971-james-denton-biography-age-family-net-worth-movies-tv-shows-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Denton biography: age, family, net worth, movies and TV shows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./married-at-first-sight-inside-michaela-and-zacks-marriage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Michaela And Zack's Marriage</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
