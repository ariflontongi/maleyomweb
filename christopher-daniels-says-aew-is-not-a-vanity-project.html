The word ‘legend’ gets thrown around quite often in pro wrestling because of popularity. Sometimes though, the status of legend is reached by those who have been at it a long time and sometimes in the smaller promotions and territories, thus not acquiring the popularity of say a John Cena or a Dwayne Johnson.</p><p>Daniels started in the industry way back in 1993 and has made his way through some of the most major promotions this business has ever seen: WWF, WCW, TNA, AEW, ROH and that list only goes on from there. He last wrestled The Bucks on AEW TV and since then made a few appearances for Impact Wrestling, where he is undoubtedly royalty.</p><p>He and Kazarian lost the match to The Bucks back in May and the stipulation was that he and Kazarian’s SCU team was made to disband should they lose. Daniels suffered quite the serious eye injury after the match and hasn’t been seen on AEW TV since. He went into just what the future holds for himself in AEW recently during an interview.</p><p>“The last match I have for AEW television was the night that we wrestled against the Bucks and unfortunately, we lost and SCU had to split up. Since that time, I had sort of been weighing my future in the ring and I decided that I still wanted to give wrestling in the ring a go.</p><p>Honestly, I would be lying if I said that I was happy going to AEW and not seeing my name on the board. I want to get back in the ring and do something with this roster. But I also realize that AEW is not a vanity project, and maybe Christopher Daniels in the ring isn’t the best thing for AEW at this time with such a stacked card and so many young talents there.</p><p>It’s not my call. I hope to get in the ring at some point soon, but if not, I also realize that I’m still contributing to AEW. And if the fates decide that my best contribution is behind the scenes, then so be it. But I’m still ready to go and the minute I see my name on the board, I’ll lace them up and bring it.”</p><p>So he is definitely excited to get back in there, but is happy to just work behind the scenes for now, as his statements prove. There are however, many possibilities for him to get back in there, especially with so many other stars close to his age rumored to be coming down the line, like say Jeff Hardy. Who knows what the future may hold?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>H/T <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SEScoops</a></p><p>December 14, 2021 1:59 pm</p><span class=author-name>Domenic Marinelli</span> <span></span><p>Domenic Marinelli is an author and freelance writer/journalist.
