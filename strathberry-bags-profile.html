Color swatches and inspiration photos line one wall; the other is covered by shelves of upcoming seasons’ samples. At a table in the center, team members handle pieces of materials, try on bags for size, and pitch new concepts. The meeting doesn’t last longer than an hour, but it makes Wednesday “the best day of the week,” Leeanne tells me over tea in the brand’s official showroom three floors below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The bag that started it all for the decade-old label had humbler origins. Strathberry’s first design was a top-handle, curved tote bag with a gold bar detail, inspired by a vintage leather music case the co-founders stumbled upon in a thrift shop. This initial design gave way to a miniature version in different shades of leather and a backpack: architectural pieces that conveyed “quiet luxury” before it was a buzzword. They were pretty but not pretentious, functional but not overly utilitarian, and they were handcrafted in Spanish workshops that also housed some of the biggest luxury conglomerates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This was enough to get the sort of endorsement some designers wait decades to earn—just four years into business.</p><img alt="a group of strathberry bags on a shelf" title="Strathberry Bags in Review 2023" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/strathberry-oct26th-489-655247c59ec5b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stew Bryden</span><p>A prototype of the first Strathberry tote bag (center) is displayed next to the vintage bag that inspired it (left) at the label’s Edinburgh headquarters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Strathberry had been steadily gathering fans in fashion and influencer circles when Meghan Markle carried the label’s two-tone mini tote on an official royal walkabout in 2017, shortly after announcing her engagement to Prince Harry. Then, she carried the brand’s East/West crossbody bag to another formal appearance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Celebrities like Margot Robbie had carried Strathberry before, but Markle was different. “Things just took off to another level,” Guy says—“things” meaning sales and media attention. Markle wore the brand more than once, and each time it drove sales. Other royal placements soon followed: Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, has also carried Strathberry (on at least three separate occasions), as have Princess Eugenie and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You’ve got to pinch yourself, because you have got these incredible individuals who’ve got their choice of any bag that they would like to choose, right?” Leeanne says. “It’s like a little gift.”</p><img alt="meghan markle carries a strathberry crossbody bag in ediburgh" title="Strathberry Bags in Review 2023" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-is-seen-during-a-walkabout-on-the-esplanade-news-photo-1699892850.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">WPA Pool</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Meghan Markle began carrying Strathberry in 2017, shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry.

Dozens of articles have been written about the Strathberry bags anointed as “royal favorites.” (This includes pieces I’ve written for Bazaar). And while the brand is grateful for its most famous fans, its founders also feel it has more to offer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think there was a point where you’re a bit … you run the risk of potentially just being known for that thing. And I think we were quite aware of that, and we didn’t feel that was right for the brand,” Leeanne reflects. “[It was] fantastic that was happening. But we also wanted to make sure that, actually, all that we were doing was coming out and it wasn’t just about that one bag.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">If Strathberry could write its own definition in the eyes of the general designer-handbag-carrying public, it would not simply be a “royal-approved” brand. It would be, Guy tells me, “the standout luxury brand from Scotland.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Right now, the Hundlebys say they’re primarily known more for their signature totes and the people who carry them than the label’s roots in Edinburgh or the breadth of its offerings. Of course, this hasn’t necessarily held Strathberry back. Guy projects the brand would generate $26 million in sales of its leather bags, cashmere, and jewelry this year, and $36 million in 2024. “The target is now to reach that $100 million in revenue within the next three to four years,” he says. Fans are also willing to spend for exclusive merchandise: An anniversary auction to benefit charities like Dress for Success and Smart Works raised over $15,000 from sales of limited-edition archival bags.</p><img alt="a wall with pictures and posters on it" title="Strathberry Bags in Review 2023" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/strathberry-oct26th-470-6552484fcaf96.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stew Bryden</span><p>In Strathberry’s offices, a collage tracks the celebrities, influencers, editors, and—yes—royals, who have worn the brand’s bags.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Strathberry’s Most Popular Bags<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Edinburgh is not known as a fashion capital, but it’s really nice because we can quietly go about what we do here and try to achieve originality and do interesting things,” Guy says. Ten years in business have given Strathberry’s team a “platform” to think bigger than the brand’s original designs. The guiding question: How can they bring the feeling of their Wednesday design meetings—warm and intimate, with an appreciation for the finer things—to life outside of the town house?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Part of the answer, the founders say, is improving Strathberry’s marketing—bringing to the fore the stories of the brand’s artisan partners in Ubrique, Spain, where its bags are made alongside pieces for Loewe and Carolina Herrera, and calling attention to the headquarters in Edinburgh. Another key is channeling the largely Scottish team’s shared heritage and warm friendliness into its designs in a clearer way. “We’re trying to engage with that [backstory] more, but not in a maybe overtly typically Scottish type way, with tartan and tweed and that kind of thing,” Leeanne says. To get there, Strathberry has hired designers whose résumés include training at more recognizably luxury brands, like J.W. Anderson, Marni, and Burberry.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Being seen as luxury brand on the level of an LVMH portfolio member takes slow and steady expansion. The United States is the label’s biggest market, but Strathberry is not planning to open a brick-and-mortar store here any time soon. When the brand adds new categories, it’s because they clearly continue a story told through the bags: Belts use the same leather as the best-selling purses. The jewelry incorporates hardware to coordinate with the music-bar decal. Cashmere speaks to the Scottish heritage of it all—it’s a material specialty of the region.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Leaping into entirely new territory—like coats built to withstand an Edinburgh winter or leather sneakers to coordinate with the handbags—isn’t a priority.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You’re just trying to create something that hopefully people think looks beautiful, but it’s also practical for them to use day in, day out,” Guy says of Strathberry’s overall strategy. “We’re not trying to do too many things, but really just to achieve the best we can in that.”</p><img alt="three strathberry bags in different colors sitting on a couch" title="Strathberry Bags in Review 2023" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/strathberry-oct26th-785-65524b5da557f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stew Bryden</span><p>Strathberry’s top-handle totes remain bestsellers in the United States, its largest market.
