It's been a minute since the Florida-based duo shared new music, though they've previously promised that more heat will be on the way this summer. During their <a href=# rel>set at Rolling Loud California</a>, they teased a single called "Piñata." Now that Yung Miami has confirmed her split from <a href=# class=text-word rel>Diddy</a>, we're sure that even more fire bars are on the way from our favourite female partners in rhyme. Aside from fans begging JT and Caresha to drop something, they've also had plenty to say about their style as of late – particularly the formers.</p><p>Not only was the "Ex For A Reason" collaborator recently compared to the Bride of Chucky for <a href=# rel>leaning into a more gothic look</a>, but now she's also facing criticism for wearing her mugshots on a hoodie. In a photo reposted on @theshaderoom, JT wears a dark sweater with at least eight photos of her in jail plastered across the front. Many of them see her smirking for the camera, while others – notably as she got older – look far more serious.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jt-isn-t-ashamed-of-her-past>JT Isn't Ashamed of Her Past</h2></span><p>As many are noting in the comments, the 30-year-old looks notably different in the mugshots compared to now. Obviously, age is a factor, but she's also undergone some plastic surgery since coming up to alter her appearance. "Got the nerve to call somebody's baby ugly," one user wrote, referencing a spat from earlier this weekend during which <a href=# rel>JT shaded Finesse2tymes</a> and an infant online. "Remember, you're not ugly. Just broke," another person quipped, reflecting on the starlet's glow-up.</p><p>"I wonder how old she was in #3?" someone else asked. "She looks about 13-14 in that one," they pointed out. While the City Girl has spoken candidly about her <a href=# rel>past scamming antics</a> and the broken home she grew up in, she's proudly since turned her life around. She recently revealed her <a href=# rel>plans to start therapy</a> and has never held back when defending those that she loves from critics and trolls. Keep scrolling to read more social media reactions to JT's new hoodie.
