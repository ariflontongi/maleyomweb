In fact, both his parents were connected to that world — his dad, James Broderick, appeared in various films and TV series, in addition to performing in theatre, while his mother, Patricia Broderick, was a painter and playwright.&nbsp;In fact, James was a familiar face to television viewers for his starring roles in cop show "Brenner,"&nbsp;which ran from 1959 until 1964, and the drama "Family,"&nbsp;airing from 1976 to 1980. He was also known for his film roles, which included co-starring opposite Al Pacino in "Dog Day Afternoon."&nbsp;</p><p>In a 2010 interview with <a href=#>Parade</a>, Matthew remembered his dad, who died of cancer&nbsp;in 1982 at the age of 55. "God, he gave me so much," Matthew recalled. "I remember I auditioned for something and didn't get the job and was very disappointed and he said, 'You always say you messed up. Why does it never occur to you that they might have messed up? Maybe you were the best one but they didn't recognize it.' It sounds obvious, but you forget stuff like that."&nbsp;</p><p>20 years earlier, Matthew discussed the influence his father had on his own acting career in a 1990 interview with the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, declaring,&nbsp;"He was a lot of the reason I went into acting."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxiaIR6fI6upa2nnJl6tb7UrZ9mpZGpwamx1maZq6eUmr%2Bqr8po</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiny-celebrity-mothers-towering-children.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tiny celebrity moms with towering children: Madonna, Kourtney Kardashian, Jennifer Garner and more</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1470024-the-moment-funke-akindele-funke-akindele-revealed-names-twin-sons-amvca-weeks-faces.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Moment Funke Akindele Revealed the Names of Twin Sons at the AMVCA, Weeks After Their Faces Were</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
