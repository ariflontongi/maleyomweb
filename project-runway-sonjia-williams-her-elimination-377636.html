The 27-year-old from Boston was assigned “seductive temptress.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Dressed to Kill: THR Shoots the Stars of ‘Project Runway’</a></strong></p><p>After the Mood shopping trip, Williams got back to the workroom to find that her gold lame fabric — which was intended to comprise a majority of the look — was missing, so she came up with a new design using green material that was inspired by Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden.</p><p>The judges were mixed on the garment, with <strong>Heidi Klum</strong> loving the color and saying she could see one of several stars wearing it on the red carpet, while <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_michael-kors data-tag=michael-kors>Michael Kors</a></strong> said: “It looks like an ice skating costume that <strong>Nancy Kerrigan</strong> skated through the banquet hall.”</p><p>For her part, Williams told reporters Tuesday that despite losing her original fabric, she was happy with her finished design and declined to consider whether she might have stuck around longer otherwise.</p><p>“I’m not really a shoulda/coulda/woulda person,” she said. “I think everything happens for a reason. I would have liked to have had the fabric, but I still made a design that I am proud of.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Mondo Guerra Recaps ‘Project Runway’: Creating an Avant-Garde Look</a></strong></p><p>Being eliminated came as a “surprise” to Williams, who won three challenges, tying with fellow designer <strong>Christopher Palu </strong>for the most won this season. She called her elimination “mind-boggling.”</p><p>“I had some inconsistencies, but everyone in the competition had inconsistencies — no person was always at the bottom,” she said. “I also think that I was one of the designers who is the most well-rounded; it was more important for me to show that I can make pants, dresses — anything you put in my way, I can make it.”</p><p>But she admitted that her ability to effectively produce different looks might have led to the judges not being able to pinpoint her design aesthetic.</p><p>“Maybe in their mind, they didn’t know who I was as a designer,” said Williams, who didn’t see her elimination episode because it was “too hard for me to watch.” But, she added, “I didn’t want to just have one look. … It’s great if someone recognizes your work, but [not] if it’s already similar to something you’ve made, or if your design aesthetic is closed-minded because all of your stuff looks one way.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>VIDEO: Heidi Klum, Tim Gunn On ‘Project Runway’ at 10</a></strong></p><p>As for possibly appearing on a future season of Project Runway: All Stars, Williams said she originally&nbsp;would have said “hell, no” to an offer — “there is so much craziness that happens with the show” — but now she might consider it.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLG%2BzqOcnKxdp8Kvw8CyZKynnp%2B2onnWoqOloZGiwG60xKtknqSZoravrdOipqdlY2yEd3%2BVaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tallit-the-prayer-shawl.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tallit (The Prayer Shawl) | My Jewish Learning</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./smart-investing-ai-stock-alerts-for-informed-decision-making-in-modern-markets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Smart Investing: AI Stock Alerts for Informed Decision-Making in Modern Markets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
