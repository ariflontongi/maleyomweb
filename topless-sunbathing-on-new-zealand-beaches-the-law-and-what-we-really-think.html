In fact, the law allows any of us to be completely nude in public. But while there is no specific offence for nudity, those going naked could face charges such as indecent exposure or performing an indecent act.</p><p>Though it is worth noting that, while indecent exposure requires displaying genitals, the law doesn’t consider full nudity to be illegal on its own, as is evidenced by Dunedin’s nude rugby tradition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/vvhu8n2F0eZUjfJ6FidrGVZHbs0=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/TAID2ST3RBAQDAIQGHR7YKEEVU.jpg"><h2 class=article__heading>Topless woman assaulted</h2><p>While the law might allow it, some have found that going topless is not always well-received.</p><p>A topless sunbather was bullied and hounded from Pt Chevalier beach where she was catching late afternoon rays in 2019 - and believes she was threatened with social media shaming if she dared call police.</p><p>The Auckland woman in her 50s said she was “terrified” after being abused by a group of about 20 people and the focus of a sustained attack by two women.</p><p>The women shouted at her, flicked and kicked sand at her, took her photograph, which the victim took as a threat it would be posted online if she went to police over their behaviour.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Leaving the beach, she encountered two young men heading down to the beach without shirts. The sight drove her to shout at the women: “Oh look! He’s got titties too!”</p><p>And then, as she crested the walkway to the beach, she turned and flashed at her abusers. “That was my last salute,” she said.</p><p>The incident left the woman too frightened to dress in the changing rooms. “I was terrified they were still following me. I knew I just had to get out of there.”</p><p>As she left, she called police to report the encounter. During the call, she expressed her bewilderment to police, saying: “I’m only an A-Cup. It’s not like I’m a double-D.”</p><p>The sunbather said it was only the second time she had encountered an adverse view from other beachgoers while on an Auckland beach. The only other occasion while topless was at a different beach, at which she heard a man say: “I didn’t know this was a nudist beach.”</p><p>“It’s not illegal to be topless. I was minding my own business. I do generally try to be discreet. They probably should have just cast their eyes somewhere else.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><b>Chris Marriner is an Auckland-based journalist covering trending news and social media.
