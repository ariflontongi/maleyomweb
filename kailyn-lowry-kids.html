And now, it’s confirmed! Yay!</p><p>Meanwhile, others have taken a renewed interest in the paternity of Kail’s fifth kid, Rio, thanks to a <a href=#>new report</a> from the popular YouTube channel Grace Report.</p><p>But we’re getting ahead of things. Let’s break down what we know about&nbsp; Kailyn Lowry’s kids.</p><h2 id=h-how-many-kids-does-kailyn-lowry-have>How Many Kids Does Kailyn Lowry Have?</h2><p>As of now, Kailyn Lowry has given birth to five sons, and a set of twins, making it a grand total of 7 kids in her brood.</p><p>She was a senior in high school when she and then boyfriend Jo Rivera conceived their first baby, welcoming Isaac in January 2010 at age 17.</p><p>While pregnant, she allowed MTV to document her journey to motherhood on Season 2 of 16 and Pregnant, launching her reality show career.&nbsp; She went on to welcome to two more sons while starring on the spinoff, Teen Mom 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/kailyn-lowry-screen-capture.png><p>She welcomed her first son off-camera in 2020, and in 2022, hid her fifth pregnancy from fans, surprising the world with son #5 in November.</p><p>Then, in 2023, she revealed she was pregnant yet again, this time with twins, adding two more to her growing brood, including her first girl!</p><h2 id=h-kailyn-lowry-s-kids-names-from-isaac-to-the-twins>Kailyn Lowry’s Kids Names, From Isaac To The Twins</h2><p>Kailyn Lowry’s oldest son is Issac, who celebrated his 14th birthday in 2023. Two years after having Issac, Kailyn welcomed Lincoln to the world; he’s now 11. It would be another five years before she had her next son, Lux, and another three years before baby Creed was born in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, Kailyn surprised fans by announcing she had been keeping her new pregnancy a secret, but had welcomed a new, healthy boy to the family, Rio, in November 2022.&nbsp;As for the twins, fans are still waiting to meet the little ones. After announcing the birth of Rio, she then <a href=#>told her “Barely Famous” podcast listeners</a>&nbsp; she was pregnant for the sixth time after leaving a Thailand vacation with “permanent souvenirs”.</p><p>Now, as far as we know (because this is what Kailyn has told fans!) the reality star will be welcoming a set of twins when she gives birth.</p><p>However, fan theories had been popping up all over social media, including the comment section of Kailyn’s posts, and many think she may be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcoming her first girl</a>.</p><p>One fan account has gone so far as to suggest they even know the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">names of the twins</a> – Iverson and Valley! However, nothing has been confirmed yet on their names. Still waiting on that one.</p><h2 id=h-kailyn-lowry-s-kids-dads-meet-the-fathers>Kailyn Lowry’s Kids’ Dads: Meet The Fathers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/kail-and-javi-on-marriage-boot-camp-1024x542.png><p>While Kailyn is a mother of seven, her sons don’t all share the same father. When Kailyn got pregnant as a teenager, it was with her high school sweetheart, Jo Rivera. The two have remained amicable through the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Then she met Javi Marroquin, who she married in 2012, and the pair welcomed Lincoln shortly after. The relationship did not last, and the pair divorced in 2017. Not too long after, Kailyn welcomed her son Lux with Chris Lopez. Their relationship was tumultuous, to say the least, but despite being on-again, off-again, they did another kid together: son Creed in July 2020.</p><p>Kailyn moved on with now boyfriend Elijah Scott after splitting from Chris, and they welcomed their first, Rio, in November 2022.</p><p>The following year, she revealed she was pregnant with twins with Elijah.</p><h2 id=h-kailyn-expecting-baby-8>Kailyn Expecting Baby #8?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/classic-kailyn-1.jpg><p>But she’s not done yet –<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> or is she</a>? Kailyn admitted on an episode of her podcast, Barely Famous, that she has a plan to have another baby, but this time, with a surrogate.</p><p>Teen Mom fans will remember Bone Estrada, Kailyn’s friend of many years, from the show. During a recent episode of Kailyn’s Barely Famous podcast, the pair revealed a plan they hatched for the MTV bestie to carry a child for the ex reality TV personality.</p><p>“You just know when you’re not done having kids and you know when you are done having kids. So there was a point where I had said that I was not done having children – we’re gonna do gender selection – and then Bone was going to carry my children or child,” the mom-of-seven said.</p><p>She went on: “An Elijah [Scott] was on board. I don’t know if your boyfriend was on board.” Bone then revealed that she “had already agreed to it” when she met her new man and had no plans to back out of the deal if that was something Kailyn wanted.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tsX2V%2BcLfAoqOypl2hvLi%2B2GaiopyjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ian-wright-home-truths-meet-his-family-here.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything you need to know about Ian Wright's family - including his happy marriage to Nancy Hallam</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./do-you-automatically-get-chlamydia-if-you-sleep-with-someone-who-has-it.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Do you automatically get chlamydia if you sleep with someone who has it?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
