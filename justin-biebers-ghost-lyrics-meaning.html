})(); You can view the lyrics, alternate interprations and sheet music for <a href=#>Justin Bieber's Ghost</a> at Lyrics.org.<p>However, the Biebs has more or less confirmed that such is not the case.&nbsp;Rather many popular musicians, in their own respective ways, have tackled the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coronavirus </a>in song.&nbsp;Interestingly, “Ghost”&nbsp;is actually Justin Bieber’s musical response to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>And being the person whom he is, he was touched by the fact that,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in his own words</a>, some loved ones became excommunicated from each other during said crisis.</p><p>And even beyond the virus itself, Justin is able to recognize that sometimes people just become physically separated for a myriad of reasons.&nbsp;Indeed as he further explained, perhaps two people may be part of each other’s lives “for a season”, and then they aren’t.&nbsp;</p><p>So in his own explanation of&nbsp;“Ghost”, Justin doesn’t describe it as being a love song.&nbsp;Rather generally speaking the loved one can also be akin to, say a friend for instance.&nbsp;Indeed we’ve all likely had close relationships in the past that one day they were there and the next was just permanently over.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Addressee</h3><p>But that being noted, within the song itself pretty much from the first verse the singer establishes that this is in fact a romantic interest he is addressee.&nbsp;</p><p>Such is logically implied considering that the states he ‘misses this person’s touch’.&nbsp; Like that isn’t the type of thing you would say to a platonic friend or family member per se.</p><p>He also implies that he took their relationship for granted.&nbsp;But now she has “<strong>cross(ed) the bridge that he can’t follow</strong>’. And what this apparently means is that as far as he’s concerned – for whatever unexplained reason – the two of them will never end up back together.&nbsp;</p><p>So now all he has left are memories of her, which is what the titular “ghost” represents.</p><p>And once again going back to the thesis sentiment, it features the vocalist missing this person “<strong>more than life</strong>”. In fact concerning her venturing off into the sunset, ‘if he could’ he would leave his own livelihood behind and “follow” her.&nbsp;</p><p>And along those same lines “<strong>her memory is ecstasy</strong>”, another statement connoting that their relationship was amorous in nature.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>All in all…</h3><p>Despite the above, the song still possesses sort of a general applicability, as the Biebs alluded to in his overall explanation of it.&nbsp;For instance, there aren’t any gender pronouns contained therein.&nbsp;</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<p>So barring the two romantic-sounding statements above, the lyrics of this track can perhaps be stretched to the point where one can argue they are not geared toward an ex.</p><p>However as far as the surface presentation goes, i.e. deciphering the song without relying on Bieber’s external explanation, then it’s a no-brainer that he is addressing an ex-girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact it is so obvious that the internet is ablaze with conspiracy theories arguing that&nbsp;“Ghost”&nbsp;is actually about Selena Gomez, whom the Biebs dated oh so many years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ghost.png><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Selena Gomez</h3><p>The aforementioned Selena Gomez who, like Justin Bieber, is one of the most-successful singers in the world, dated the Biebs. Their relationship was very inconsistent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for almost eight full years</a>, from early 2010 to late 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>The same year that they definitively broke up, in 2018, was also the same year that Justin went on to marry Hailey Baldwin, someone whom Bieber also had been dating&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">since 2015</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But even ’til now after getting married, he may occasionally drop a song that some fans feel is actually about Selena Gomez.&nbsp; Perhaps such is to be expected considering how long they dated, and the fact that, as a result, many people (i.e.&nbsp;Jelenas, as they are called) may never be able not to see them as a couple.&nbsp;</p><p>But by and large such theories are never backed up by any actual proof.&nbsp;For instance, the most-telling evidence in this particular track&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is supposed to be</a>&nbsp;something like the name of the song being inspired by an old Selena Gomez tune from 2010 entitled&nbsp;“<a href=#>Ghost of You</a>“.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Writing Credits for “Ghost”</h3><p>Justin Bieber wrote this song alongside the following:</p><ul><li>Michael Pollack</li><li>Jon Bellion</li><li>Monsters & Strangerz&nbsp;members Stefan Johnson and Jordan K. Johnson&nbsp;</li></ul><p>And it was also The Monsters & Strangerz (as a unit) as well as Bellion who produced the track.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Release Date of “Ghost”</h3><p>This song is derived from Justin Bieber’s&nbsp;“Justice”, his sixth-studio album, which came out on 19 March 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a product of Def Jam Records, a label traditionally associated with rap music that has since ventured off into other genres.&nbsp;And other labels that supported it are Universal Music as well as Scooter Braun’s Schoolboy Records, RBMG Records and SB Projects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ghost-by-Justin-Bieber.jpg><p>Justin didn’t release this as a single.
