These are just 10 tribes that come from all over Nigeria. Once again, this is just our ideas and we hope that our readers can offer their own views regarding the most educated state in Nigeria and the most educated people.</p><h3>Igbo</h3><p class=align-left>This community is one of the biggest in Nigeria. There are many farmers and traders among Igbo people. It is believed that this tribe is very educated. By the way, many representatives of this tribe love to gain new knowledge, self-develop and implement creative business ideas into life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bbc287797d0148cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 universities in Nigeria: Which great institutions are these?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Yes, Igbos have many businesspersons among them. There are even sayings that there is nothing good in places where you don’t meet Igbo businessmen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bbc287797d0148cb.jpg><h3>Yoruba</h3><p class=align-left>This tribe is also one of the biggest in the country. Many of its representatives get high job positions, become professors, and reach other educational heights.</p><p class=align-left>Yoruba people often become top managers and lead the companies.</p><h3>Hausa</h3><p class=align-left>This ethnic group is also one of the largest in Nigeria along with Yoruba and Igbo. This community prefers the life in villages and small towns as well as rural areas.</p><p class=align-left>Hausa who live in big cities are educated. They like to explore new spheres and they are good at planning. Many representatives of this tribe are good entrepreneurs.</p><p class=align-left>Those members who live in rural territories get a lower level of education. Most of these people cannot read or write and have to work in agriculture or stay unemployed.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb4f6c5ad6886401.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 most developed states in Nigeria in 2019</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6kdvllat9jc.jpg><h3>Urhobo</h3><p class=align-left>The tribe mostly lives in the Niger Delta area. Just like many other modern communities, Urhobo people follow the trend and gain their education. Many families have their own professors.</p><h3>Edo</h3><p class=align-left>These people like to migrate. They often go overseas searching for better life. Being highly civilized, they also get a good level of education.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top 5 most educated states in Nigeria</p><h3>Ijaw</h3><p class=align-left>This Nigerian tribe has many educated people. This is why we have added it to our list of the citizens who are schooled and continue to get knowledge, self-improve, and develop throughout their lives.</p><h3>Itsekiri</h3><p class=align-left>The community lives in the same areas as Urhobo people. Representatives from Itsekiri tribe also do their best to get an education. If the family leader is not educated, he makes sure his kids would gain the knowledge in different spheres of life.</p><h3>Isoko</h3><p class=align-left>This tribe doesn’t have as many people as other majority communities from Nigeria. Still, it is known that the representatives of Isoko community do get an education and deserve their place on our list.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/25842d89c38eac48.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 wealthiest bloggers in Nigeria</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb4f6c5ad6886401.jpg><h3>Calabar</h3><p class=align-left>Many of us like the interesting intonation you can hear when a Calabar person speaks. This tribe is educated. You can watch Nollywood movies to understand this.</p><h3>Ibibio</h3><p class=align-left>Is this tribe schooled? Like many other communities, Ibibios also get their education and many of the members know a lot.</p><p class=align-left>Many individuals of hundreds of Nigerian tribes do get an education too This includes the Nupe people, Ndoro, Igalla, Jaku, Kamo, and many other communities we haven’t listed.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Hausa culture and traditions in Nigeria: top facts to know</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnKBj2pqbmWkpL1ufY9mnJ2tk5bBprCMramimpWoeq%2B1xp6poplencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1560144-tyla-hits-1-billion-views-tiktok-smash-hit-water-sa-celebrates-deserves-fully.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyla Hits 1 Billion Views on TikTok With Smash Hit Water, SA Celebrates: She Deserves It Fu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boldify-hairline-powder-early-amazon-prime-day-7557214.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Sweat-Proof Hairline Powder Conceals Thinning Hair and Bald Spots</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
