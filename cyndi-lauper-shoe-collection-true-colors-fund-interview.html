Ever since, Lauper has been a staunch supporter of LGBT rights, becoming a fixture at gay pride events and raising money through charity work. Now, she's parlaying her unwavering belief in equality into something tangible with the launch of her shoe collection with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>M4D3</a> (Make a Difference Everyday), an organization dedicated to creating products with a purpose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The three-piece line, priced between $65 and $75, includes a denim hi-top sneaker, a leopard print slip-on sneaker, and a men's white hi-top sneaker. "Each style was designed to be worn in all kinds of situations," Lauper told InStyle. Proceeds from sales benefit the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>True Colors Fund</a>, her foundation which works to end homelessness among gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender youth across the country. Below, we spoke to Lauper about the collaboration, '80s fashion trends, and the cause closest to her heart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why sneakers?</strong><br>"We tried to make something that was interesting and fun to wear, that you could rock any way you want—whether you’re conservative or more outgoing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How would you style them?</strong><br>"I’d wear them with fishnets underneath, but they work just as well with a faded ripped boyfriend jean, or a thick sock."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sounds pretty ‘80s! Would you say your fashion sense has changed a lot since then?</strong><br>"I love fashion. It changes all the time, but I’m not going to wear what I wore in the ‘80s. That was a whole different time—I think I’d look quite ridiculous with all the makeup and crazy hairdos. I wear what feels empowering. Above all, whatever you wear has to bring you joy. It should be glamorous and make you feel good about yourself. And that’s the most important thing about style: You should know what works for your body and what doesn’t."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alex Reside for InStyle.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Is there one look from that decade you’d never bring back?</strong><br>"I think everything comes back in style—you just wear it differently. Maybe a vintage corset with jeans."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>You’ve championed the LGBT community for years, and they’ve embraced you as an icon. What sparked your interest initially?</strong><br>"I’m the aunt and cousin or sister you can’t get rid of. Initially, I got involved because nobody else was getting involved. I wasn’t going to sit idly and watch my family members and dear friends have their civil rights stripped [Ed note: Lauper's older sister, Ellen, is a lesbian and activist in the gay community]. Everyone was totally disenfranchised and was contemplating suicide. Something had to be done. You should never kill yourself because you’re different. There are a lot of great people who didn’t blend in who were different."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Thanks to trailblazing activists like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Laverne Cox</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Caitlyn Jenner</a>, there’s been a lot of positive change in recent years.</strong><br>"There has been some change, but I wish in my heart that those changes had come sooner for those who were forced to live through a harder time. Forty percent of the 1.6 million kids out there are homeless right now, and identify as LGBT. We have to educate people and their parents, too."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop the True Colors Collection now at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>shop.m4d3shoes.com</a> and visit <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>truecolorsfund.org</a> to learn more about the cause.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PHOTOS: Laverne Cox: "I'm a Self-made Woman in Every Sense of the Word"</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeTrrultYylmK6olad6tLTOnmScp5yhsqTAyKilZqyiqrJur86lpqurXZvCr7CMoqWtnaKrtqbD</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./423150-dj-akademiks-explains-comments-about-sex-with-minors-says-he-meant-in-college-news.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DJ Akademiks Explains Comments About Sex With Minors, Says He Meant In College</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christopher-daniels-says-aew-is-not-a-vanity-project.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christopher Daniels Says AEW Is Not A Vanity Project</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
