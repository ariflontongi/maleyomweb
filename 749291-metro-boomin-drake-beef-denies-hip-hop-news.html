Moreover, you've definitely heard by now that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a> and Drake, according to many fans, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">threw shots at each other</a> in recent times. This stemmed from the former complaining that the latter's Her Loss won in rap album categories in award shows and rankings over Metro's HEROES & VILLAINS. Then, the 6ix God seemed to respond in a Stake stream, and more cryptic social media activity had fans crafting theories and connecting presumed dots. But according to the St. Louis native, people took this way too far.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, he recently spent some time answering fan questions on Twitter, as he's usually very active on the platform. Specifically, Metro Boomin chose to indulge one listener's inquiry about the supposed Drake beef and put an end to the rumors. "Are u and Drake seriously beefing or is it not that deep," the user asked him. "Not deep at all lmao," the 30-year-old replied. While he said it's not deep, he technically didn't say it was nonexistent, so fans will surely keep making assumptions despite this shutdown. Regardless, the "Metro Spider" beatsmith has bigger things on his mind right now, like officially claiming <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the most streamed rap album in 2023</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-metro-boomin-clarifies-drake-situation>Metro Boomin Clarifies Drake Situation</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, the two have collaborated often in the past– in fact, Metro Boomin even has a beat on Her Loss. As such, maybe one more collaborative effort will squash this once and for all, or once the Grammys roll around and they have to congratulate each other or sympathize with each other's losses to either <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Killer Mike</a>, or <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nas</a>. Only time will tell, but we might get an answer soon. The Boominati boss recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">teased new music</a> with Paul Wall, so he'll probably have plenty of chances in 2024 to throw Drake on a song or to have him hop on one of his beats.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, we're still waiting on his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">collab album</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>, which the beatmaker said he'll finish soon. With so much potential there, we'll be as patient as necessary. Who knows, maybe this is where the What A Time To Be Alive chemistry will quell these beef suppositions. With that in mind, log back into HNHH for more news and the latest updates on Metro Boomin and Drake.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures.
