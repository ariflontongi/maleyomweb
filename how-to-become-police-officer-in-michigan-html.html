could do that!</span><span>" (Spoiler alert:</span><span> CSI isn't quite how real police work goes,</span><span> but hey,</span><span> at least you have enthusiasm!</span><span>) Well,</span><span> buckle up because becoming a police officer in Michigan is an exciting journey,</span><span> filled with more twists and turns than a drunken ferret in a sock drawer.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:42>First Things First: You Got the Goods?</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:56><span>Before you suit up and hit the streets like RoboCop,</span><span> there are a few basic requirements to tick off.</span><span> We're talking the kind of stuff even your grandma wouldn't mess with:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=9:1-10:167><li data-sourcepos=9:1-9:90><strong>Be 18 or older:</strong><span> This one's a no-brainer.</span><span> You can't chase down bad guys on a tricycle,</span><span> now can you?</span></li><li data-sourcepos=10:1-10:167><strong>Be a US citizen:</strong><span> Gotta uphold the law of the land,</span><span> and all that jazz.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=11:1-11:75><strong>Have a clean record:</strong><span> No past felonies,</span><span> otherwise you'll be applying to protect and serve...</span><span> from inside a jail cell.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=12:1-12:93><strong>Driver's license:</strong><span> You gotta get around somehow,</span><span> unless you plan on chasing purse snatchers on a unicycle (see previous tricycle point).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=13:1-13:99><strong>High school diploma or GED:</strong><span> Basic education is key,</span><span> you'll need to understand those pesky laws you're gonna enforce.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=16:1-16:21><strong>Bonus points for:</strong></p><ul data-sourcepos=18:1-21:0><li data-sourcepos=18:1-18:91><strong>A college degree:</strong><span> Shows you can stick with something and learn a thing or two (hopefully something

(well,</span><span> maybe not </span>fun<span>,</span><span> but definitely important):</span><span> </span><strong>training</strong><span>.</span><span> Michigan requires all police officers to attend a certified police academy.</span><span> Think of it as college for cops,</span><span> but way more exciting (hopefully less cafeteria food).</span><span> You'll learn everything from chasing suspects like a ninja to filing paperwork that would make a sloth look speedy.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=31:1-31:306><strong>Here's a sneak peek at what you can expect:</strong></p><ul

to handle a weapon safely and responsibly.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=33:1-34:0><strong>De-escalation tactics:</strong><span> Not every situation requires a takedown.</span><span> Learn how to
