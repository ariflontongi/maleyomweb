(“PJ&A”) filed a notice of data breach on behalf of Concentra Health Services, Inc. (“Concentra”) after discovering that PJ&A experienced a data breach affecting information belonging to Concentra patients. In this notice, PJ&A explains that the incident resulted in an unauthorized party being able to access consumers’ sensitive information, which includes their names and Social Security numbers. Upon completing its investigation, PJ&A began sending out data breach notification letters to all individuals whose information was affected by the recent data security incident.</span></span></p><p><span><span>If you received a data breach notification from Perry Johnson & Associates, Inc. or Concentra Health Services, it is essential you understand what is at risk and what you can do about it.</span></span><span><span> While this incident didn’t involve Concentra’s computer network, it did impact Concentra's patients. This is because hackers were able to access Concentra data by breaching PJ&A, one of Concentra’s vendors. A data breach lawyer can help you learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, as well as discuss your legal options following the PJ&A / Concentra data breach. For more information, please see our recent piece on the topic </span></span><u><a href=#><span><span><span><span>here</span></span></span></span></a></u><span><span>.</span></span></p><h2>What Caused the Data Breach Affecting Concentra Patients?</h2><p><span><span>The PJ&A / Concentra data breach was only recently announced, and more information is expected in the near future. However, PJ&A’s filing with the Attorney General of Maine provides some important information on what led up to the breach.</span></span></p><p><span><span>According to this source, PJ&A is a medical transcription company that provides its services to various healthcare providers, including Concentra. On May 2, 2023, PJ&A detected suspicious activity within its computer network. In response, PJ&A launched an investigation with the help of third-party cybersecurity specialists.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Ultimately, the PJ&A investigation confirmed that an unauthorized party was able to access the company’s computer network between March 27, 2023 and May 2, 2023. More specifically, PJ&A learned that the unauthorized party was able to access Concentra patient information between April 7, 2023 and April 19, 2023.</span></span></p><p><span><span>After learning that sensitive consumer data was accessible to an unauthorized party, PJ&A reviewed the compromised files to determine what information was leaked and which consumers were impacted. Once PJ&A completed its investigation, it notified Concentra. Concentra then launched its own investigation. While the breached information varies depending on the individual, it may include your name and Social Security number. PJ&A’s filing with the Maine Attorney General indicates that there were 13,300,750 people affected by the breach.</span></span></p><p><span><span>On February 4, 2024, PJ&A sent out data breach letters to anyone who was affected by the recent data security incident. These letters should provide victims with a list of what information belonging to them was compromised. Note that Concentra’s computer network was not breached, and all compromised data was stored on PJ&A’s network.</span></span></p><h2>More Information About Perry Johnson & Associates, Inc. and Concentra Health Services, Inc.</h2><p><span><span>Perry Johnson & Associates is a transcription company with a headquarters in Henderson, Nevada.
