The co-founder and executive director of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>African American Policy Forum</a> put a name to the concept 25 years ago after realizing that attention to police brutality didn't always include violence against Black women, and that feminist fights for equity often left people of color behind — that an intersectional approach would be the only way forward. Her work is more pressing than ever now, as the misguided mantra of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>"this isn't America"</a> still falls out of the mouths of people who can't believe white nationalist terrorists were all but allowed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>into the Capitol building</a> amid a violent siege.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It just always astonishes me, it's so easy for those who are uncomfortable with dealing with our history, uncomfortable with our institutions being reformed so they work better for everybody, [to say] that that's un-American," Crenshaw told InStyle as part of our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Badass Women</a> issue. "So intersectionality, critical race theory, implicit bias and structural racism [awareness], those are tools to allow people to say, 'Look, we built this thing with a lot of material that isn't really good stuff, it's like asbestos, it's all in our foundation and our structure, and our goal is to get rid of it because it's toxic.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's a metaphor for how certain problems in this country haven't been tackled head-on, or have been treated as separate issues when they are so intermingled as to really be one. So, along with co-founder Luke Harris, she launched the AAPF with the goal to promote a vision of social justice that is fully intersectional. Now, they're working on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Say Her Name </a>initiative (launched in 2014) to expose what she calls the double loss families experience when a Black woman is killed by police (the loss of a loved one, and of the ability to grieve publicly when we don't collectively 'say her name').</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Black women have been subject to state violence, institutional violence, sexual violence since we got here," Crenshaw says. "We try to historicize and give people the sense of — this stuff is happening now, here's what you miss if you don't have an intersectional viewpoint of what gender-based violence looks like."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shes-a-badass></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why She's a Badass</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crenshaw is a lawyer, an activist, and a professor at Columbia Law School and the UCLA School of Law. Born in Canton, Ohio, during the throes of the civil-rights movement, Crenshaw followed in the footsteps of her father, who was studying law at the time of his death, to earn her J.D. from Harvard Law School and LL.M. from the University of Wisconsin Law School before co-founding the African American Policy Forum (AAPF). When she's not giving lectures, she's busy moderating her webinar series, Under the Blacklight, which focuses on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>race gaps in vulnerability to COVID-19</a>, she's furthering the conversation on anti-Black violence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Critical race theory, the view that laws and systems perpetuate racial inequality, was at the bedrock of Crenshaw's academic studies, and at Columbia, a lively debate about race eventually turned into the first workshop at the school's Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies, founded by Crenshaw in 2011. "Leadership is about loving yourself and the people you're fighting for enough to face the consequences for speaking out," Crenshaw says. "Every stage of my life is defined by not taking any crap," she says. "Badasses are the ones who demand a fuller, more vibrant existence — one based on justice and not just comfort."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Crenshaw with Anita Hill (left) and Gloria Steinem at the 2020 Makers Conference in L.A.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rachel Murray/Getty</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-shes-wearing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What She's Wearing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Crenshaw was growing up, Nancy Sinatra's 1966 hit, "These Boots Are Made for Walkin,'" was a staple of the radio, cementing boots as the power shoe of the moment. So when she began attending civil-rights protests in law school, Crenshaw would always strap on a pair. "Boots are for when I'm trying to say, 'It's on,'" she says. "They make me feel like I'm going to war." A red Western style by Texas bootmaker Lucchese is currently in heavy rotation. "The color is unusual and really does spark joy," she says. "Those boots tell people not to mess with me. Even the way I walk in them — you don't teeter in boots, you stomp."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-shes-watching></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What She's Watching</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Should a gap in her schedule arise, Crenshaw enjoys kicking back with a good TV show. "The worst thing to ever happen to me was discovering Netflix auto-play," she says. "It sucks you in, and before you know it, you've watched hours of television." Right now she's a fan of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bridgerton</a> ("It's fascinating to reimagine what could've been had the elite not been so damn racist") and HBO's Lovecraft Country ("It's like watching applied intersectionality"). More than anything, Crenshaw is "enjoying this moment where people's experiences with race find their way into pop culture rather than being treated as issues that should not be talked about." She remembers decades when Black women's stories were simply left out of the mainstream. "I don't take it for granted that we'll always have this entertainment; I hope we do. I'm looking forward to it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more stories like this, pick up the March 2021 issue of InStyle, available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>digital download</a> Feb 12th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z6ijoqyZmMBuv86coJqkXZ7AtMHErGabmZSWwLR51qiknqZfoLaursSro55lk6eyr7%2FHmq4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./king-charles-possible-coronation-setback-buckingham-palace-flypast.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>King Charles: Major coronation moment now in doubt</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keanu-reeves-and-rarely-seen-girlfriend-alexandra-grant-turn-heads-at-racing-event-in-germany.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keanu Reeves and rarely-seen girlfriend Alexandra Grant turn heads at racing event in Germany</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
