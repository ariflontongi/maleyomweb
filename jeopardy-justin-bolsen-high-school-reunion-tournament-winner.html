tune played.</p><p>Indeed, he nearly doubled up to $21,991 and his two-day score was revealed to be $35,561.</p><p>Jackson was left with a smidge less - $35,198 - and Maya with $24,610 - so Justin narrowly but decisively took win and looked absolutely thrilled.</p><p>He flashed a winning grin as a golden $100K flashed over his podium.</p><p>"Congratulations Justin, you won $100,000 and you're in the <a href=#>Tournament of Champions!</a>" Mayim exclaimed as the live crowd roared.</p><p>The other two finalists did not go home empty-handed - Jackson gets $50K and Maya $25K, all clapping graciously.</p><h2>'JEOPARDY! KIDS EDITION?'</h2><p>On Reddit, fans knocked the tournament's final clue for being a little obvious.</p><p>One fan wrote: "Was that one of the easiest FJs ever? That might be the most literal description of a landmark that's already one of the most iconic and thought of landmarks in the world."</p><p>Another wrote: "It’s absurd, honestly. The difficulty was all over the place this tournament, but that could’ve been the final of a Jeopardy Kids edition."</p><p>A third wondered: "Was that really the Final Jeopardy question? May as well have told them it's in France while you're at it."</p><h2>DARK HORSE!</h2><p>But the rest celebrated Justin's unexpected win (given he was behind Jackson going in) as one wrote: "I’m so happy for Justin! He’s just the cutest!!"</p><p>"Pays to wear a suit, boys," wrote another.</p><p>One of the semi-finalists <a href=#>Caleb Richmond</a> wrote he was in the audience and that "Justin has a resounding fan club."</p><p>Justin is studying economics and international and public affairs at Brown.</p><p>In his quarter-finals game, Justin showed he was not messing around with a huge&nbsp;<a href=#>$8,800 Daily Double bet</a>, and advancing from there.</p><p>Waiting in the wings to now face him are some serious quizzers like <a href=#>Cris Pannullo (21 wins)</a> and <a href=#>Troy Meyer (6 wins).</a></p><p>“It’s going to be crazy,” Justin said in a statement. “I think everybody knows that people who go on mega-streaks are really, really good, so I can only hope to do my best against them. We’ll see what they have in store for me.”</p><p>It's worth noting right now the <a href=#>2023 Tournament of Champions has a lineup of only men</a>, but he earned his way there and who doesn't love a dark horse?</p><h2>GLITCH FOR THE BOOKS</h2><p>There was a newsmaking blunder last episode and in the first half of the finals which smudged <a href=#>Jeopardy!'s</a> record a bit.</p><p>The contestants' final scores on their podiums flashed on-screen for multiple seconds before the game had begun.</p><p><a href=#>The U.S. Sun was the first to report the antenna-adjusting incident</a>&nbsp;on March 8's episode when it aired.</p><p>Mayim was congratulating the finalists and wished them good luck when the camera cut to their final tallies showing.</p><p><a href=#>Jackson's</a>&nbsp;$24,000,&nbsp;Justin's&nbsp;$13,570, and&nbsp;Maya's&nbsp;$3,370 (combined with their scores tonight) remained on screen for several seconds and were indeed their totals in the end.</p><p><a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;could not spoil the ultimate result of the college students’ fierce faceoff, because it’s a two-game match, but it certainly caused a ruckus.</p><p>Clamoring fans took to Twitter calling the slip-up everything from a "big oopsie" to a "horrendous" look for the&nbsp;<a href=#>game show</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 47 is returning tomorrow, March 10 to&nbsp;<a href=#>host regular episodes</a> with reigning champ Stephen Webb trying to go for win 4 which would also qualify him for the 2023 Tournament of Champions.</p><p><a href=#>The G.O.A.T contestant</a> will be hosting regular episodes until May 1, welcome news for those who have been mixed on <a href=#>Mayim's hosting chops and her noticeable pauses.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/taken-without-permission-class-dismissed-801694757.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/taken-without-permission-class-dismissed-801694666.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/taken-without-permission-class-dismissed-801694667.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZW5%2BdYCVaKGep6CWv6XFjKOsrKyZo3qju8usnKdlmJ60qXnSnJ%2Bop5xiv6bBzaKmp2WkpMKzusCmnKesXay2r7rEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1337347-jessica-brown-findlay-bio-age-height-partner-movies-tv-shows-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jessica Brown Findlay bio: age, height, partner, movies and TV shows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-gunn-blue-beetle-dcu-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Gunn Is Making Blue Beetle Part Of The DCU</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
