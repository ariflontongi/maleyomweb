In life, some who knew them described the relationship as almost reversed. It was Costello who was the hot-tempered and difficult one, with Abbott the loyal follower who endured frequent arguments with his partner. Though they were friends, by the time cameras rolled on "Dance With Me, Henry," the two had weathered severe altercations, and the personal and professional bonds between them were weakening.</p><p>One of their fights was over money and credit. The pair's earnings were originally split 60/40 in Abbott's favor, later moving to 50/50. Costello&nbsp;— egged on, in his daughter's estimation, by the sycophants around him (per Chris Costello's "<a href=#>Lou's On First: A Biography</a>")&nbsp;— eventually wanted the 60 percent for himself and top billing, the latter demand only frustrated because Universal refused. "Dad backed off," his daughter wrote, "but from then on, there was a permanent chill between my father and Bud whenever they weren't actually working."</p><p>Away from work, Abbott and Costello infamously fell out in 1945 over household staff. Abbott still supported Costello's charitable endeavors, and Costello helped Abbott with his epilepsy. But Abbott's drinking, largely done to cope with his condition, was affecting work by 1956. And Costello had been nursing a desire to change his work, to do something more dramatic, for some time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kmtrbWpkZK6jrs6tq2abn6jBprjLqKpmpJGowW65zq%2BgnmWSmrOwvsRmm6KdlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-26t-in-bicycle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is 26t in bicycle?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tess-atkins-net-worth-188112.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tess Atkins Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1586291-i-woke-decision-nigerian-woman-daughter-flaunt-transformation-haircut.html>&amp;quot;I Woke Up and Took the Decision&amp;quot;: Nigerian Woman and Daughter Flaunt Transformation after Haircut</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1543620-man-weeps-a-baby-video-reunites-twin-sister-years.html>&amp;quot;Please Go with Him&amp;quot;: Man Weeps Like a Baby in Video as He Reunites with Twin Sister After Many Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-sulfate-free-shampoos.html>17 Best Sulfate Free Shampoos 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-1-2023.html>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 1, 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1589180-air-peace-dana-airlines-set-cut-airfares-dangote-begins-sale-aviation-fuel.html>Air Peace, Dana, Other Airlines Set to Cut Airfares Further as Dangote Begins Sale Aviation Fuel</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe.
