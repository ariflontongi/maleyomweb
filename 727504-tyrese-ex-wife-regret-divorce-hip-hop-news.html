For those unaware, the two are currently feuding quite heavily over the circumstances and post-breakup divisions in their relationship, whether on personal terms or in court. However, it seems like this bad blood hasn't blinded her to what she sees as a mistake. Moreover, Lee recently appeared on the Hardly Initiated podcast with co-hosts Ryan Catchings and Tysean Jackson. During her appearance, she recalled how over three years of marriage went down the drain because of bad influences.</p><p>"It’s very important to seek wise counsel," Samantha Lee remarked of the Tyrese situation. "You have to really decide and make a very calculated decision based on your belief systems. “I think we do take divorce very casually. I would never tell a woman to walk through that. [Not] in the same frame as I was when I did it. I was very, very, hurt, I was very angry. I remember when I made the decision. [When] I was hysterically crying on the phone with my attorney, I was not in any position to make that decision, I was extremely emotionally intoxicated. I would never tell somebody to make that decision when they’re that emotional but of course, I wasn’t talking to someone that genuinely would be for marriage or for reconciliation.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Tyrese, Ginuwine & Tank Set The Past Aside To Bring TGT Back</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tyrese-s-ex-wife-samantha-lee-speaks-on-what-falsely-led-her-to-consider-divorce>Tyrese's Ex-Wife Samantha Lee Speaks On What Falsely Led Her To Consider Divorce</h2></span><p>"That’s no slight to my attorney," Samantha Lee continued about her split from Tyrese. "At the time when I was on the phone and I made that decision, I was livid. I was emotional. If I’m that emotional and I’m that hurt and I’m on that level, if it’s misguided and misdirected it could go in a bad direction. The people I had in my ear at the time were not for that. The truth about the matter is that if I had different people in my ear at that time I would not have made that decision.&nbsp;I’m an extremely emotional person. There will be moments where, like, ’I’m ready to be done, I can’t stand this! He don’t do this!' We’re just focusing on these things. You don’t have a certain person in your life to check you and say ‘Sis, what about this, what about these strengths?'</p><p>“You may not be thinking about when you’re upset," she concluded. “You’re only thinking about <a href=# rel>what you’re mad about</a>, you’re not thinking about all the other positive aspects of this person. So in those moments, you need somebody to be that person for that person in those moments.&nbsp;You don’t win when a family is broken apart. There was a marital therapist that was speaking to both me and him. He said when you get lawyers involved, it gets ugly. I didn’t even realize how ugly it would get. Like, if I could walk back in time... Sometimes I battle with myself about that. But at the time, I thought I was doing the right thing or the best thing. <a href=# rel>I didn’t know how ugly it could get</a>."
