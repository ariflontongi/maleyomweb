She's a mother, an iconic rapper, an actress, and a businesswoman. Earlier this year, the Queen officially announced that she was starting her own record label. There wasn't much news about it afterward, except for rumors here and there that she had signed <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a>. A few weeks ago, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Nicki and Ice Spice released a collaboration called</a> "Princess Diana." It was originally a single from Ice Spice's 2022 EP, but Nicki had been rumored to jump on it for a while. When it was released, fans noticed that "Heavy On It" was listed among the labels that distributed the collab. In addition, Nicki says the alleged label name at the beginning of the song. While she has yet to officially confirm the name, she did give a cheeky reply to one fan on Twitter who pointed it out.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nicki Minaj also recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">claimed in a tweet that she would be seated beside Prince Harry at King Charles' coronation</a> ceremony. The Queen has a reputation for trolling, and it now appears to have just been a promotional tactic for her new verse on the "Princess Diana" remix. The song was released two weeks ago, and it has been all over the place ever since. In fact, earlier this week, it landed at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. This was another big win for the Queen, who broke <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>'s previous Billboard record with the track. It was also a win for Ice Spice, who now has two singles in the top 10. Now, Nicki is taking some much-deserved family time.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-nicki-s-papa-bear-is-growing-up-fast>Nicki's "Papa Bear" Is Growing Up Fast</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nicki Minaj may be the Queen of Rap, but today she reminded fans that she's also a mom. Originally, she announced that she was retiring from music in order to focus on family. While that didn't turn out to be exactly true, she certainly has built a beautiful family over the last few years. In July 2020, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Nicki shared a photo of her baby bump</a> on her Instagram, confirming news that fans had already suspected: she was pregnant. Later that year, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she gave birth</a> to a baby boy, whom she affectionately refers to as "Papa Bear." The rapper doesn't always post family-related photos, but earlier today she shared a look into her life as a mother.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the adorable photos that Nicki posted, her son can be seen dressed in stylish outfits. "Papa Bear" is all smiles as his mother takes photos of him while he eats and plays. The Barbz took to the comment section of the post to share their love, most of them simply posting heart emojis. Nicki recently revealed that her new follow-up album to 2018's Queen will be coming this year. So, she is likely enjoying some downtime before things get crazy again. What do you think of the photos of "Papa Bear"?
